v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> little needs to be said to
introduce these Lectures to the reader.&nbsp; They were delivered
in Advent last, at Saint Mary&rsquo;s, Newington; and there is
the same reason for publishing, which there then was for writing
and preaching them.&nbsp; I desire to assist, as far as I am
able, those who are seeking to clear and define their thoughts,
respecting the origin, nature, and power of the Christian
Ministry.&nbsp; I have aimed only at plainness and fairness in
the statement of the argument; and have adopted <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>that
arrangement of the subject, in which, as far as I can judge, it
originally came before my own mind.</p>
<p>In the Dedication of this Volume to the Regius Professor of
Hebrew at Oxford, I have acknowledged my great obligation to him
for the instruction which I hope I have derived from his
writings&mdash;an acknowledgment which, happily, I am so far from
being singular in making, that I suppose every one who has
studied them, might make the same statement.&nbsp; But it is
right that I should say, that as I have not learned a lesson by
rote, but, from the first, thought patiently and freely for
myself, so the Public must not consider the Professor answerable
for every opinion which I may have expressed.&nbsp; And it may be
well also to add, that the general doctrine here set forth is <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>not hastily
taken up on any man&rsquo;s authority; but was maintained by the
writer, both in private and public, as many will bear witness,
long before he had the happiness and advantage of being
acquainted with the works, or characters, of the present leading
Divines of the University of Oxford.</p>

THE DOCTRINE.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">From the Epistle</span>.
<a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;How, then, shall they call
on <span class="smcap">Him</span> in Whom they have not
believed?&mdash;and, How shall they believe in Him of Whom they
have not heard?&mdash;and, How shall they hear without a
preacher?&mdash;and, How shall they preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Romans</span> x. 14.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this season of preparation for
the <span class="smcap">Advent</span>, the Apostolical Ministry
is one of the subjects especially brought before us by the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>, as doubtless peculiarly calculated
to fit our minds for the right reception and reverent
contemplation of our <span class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span>
first and second Coming.&nbsp; It would be needless to enlarge on
the suitability of the Epistle selected for this Introductory
Festival, opening and leading the way, as it does, to those of
the whole &ldquo;glorious company of the <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>Apostles.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can scarcely read the passage
now quoted, without recognizing at once much of its
appropriateness.&nbsp; It contains a brief vindication both of
the moral necessity and the Divine authority of the Christian
Ministry; and so plainly, that, to some extent, all must perceive
it.&nbsp; But it may be highly profitable to us to draw out and
examine with attention the subject, which St. Paul thus lays
before us in epitome only; concerning which we know that there is
much diversity of thinking among professing Christians, and,
consequently, great danger of wrong thinking.</p>
<p>It is too much the practice of modern theologians to refer to
the New Testament, almost as if it were a book of aphorisms; and
so, when a quotation is made therefrom, it seems to be inquired,
what meaning it will <i>bear</i>; or what use can be <i>made</i>
of it; rather than, what meaning it <i>must</i> have had in such
a connection; or what use <i>must</i> have been intended, under
such circumstances.&nbsp; And hence has resulted this fatal
consequence, that the apostolic writings are commonly interpreted
by modern opinions, instead of modern opinions being tested by
the apostolic writings.&nbsp; There is but too painful evidence
of this, in the manner in which some men set about
&ldquo;proving&rdquo; <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>their peculiar system by the
Scriptures; evidently assuming from the first that their system
is <i>right</i>, and so (unconsciously, we trust,) sorting and
arranging the &ldquo;best texts&rdquo; to establish it.&nbsp;
Surely an attempt to treat any other ancient book as the Holy
Scriptures are thus treated, would not be borne with.&nbsp;
Suppose, for example, any disciple of the schools of the modern
scepticism should attempt to show, from selected passages of some
leading treatise of ancient philosophy, that his own opinions
precisely coincided with those of the sage from whom he was
quoting; it is evident that he would hereby deceive no one but
himself.&nbsp; On a reference to the treatise in question, it
would be at once apparent, that it was written by one who held
opinions widely different from the modern.&nbsp; Now since, among
Christians, there is an universal appeal to the Scriptures, would
it not be a rational method of testing the opinions of any of the
various classes among us, to inquire, whether it is likely that
such writings <i>would</i> have proceeded from the pens of men
holding such and such opinions?&nbsp; Might we not thus arrive at
as sure a conclusion, notwithstanding all arguments from texts
and passages, that some nominally Christian opinions now
received, were not the opinions of the sacred writers&mdash;as
that the opinions of Locke were not <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the opinions of the ancient
Epicureans, notwithstanding the coincidences that might be
found?&nbsp; And if it should be seen that any class of opinions
exactly harmonizes with the literal writings of the Apostles, so
that we may imagine the men who held them to have naturally
written what the Apostles wrote; then, should we not have a
highly probable argument for the Scriptural character of those
opinions?&nbsp; Such an argument will in some degree pervade
these Lectures.</p>
<p>Few, perhaps, will fail to perceive some wide difference
between that state of mind which is implied by our popular
Christianity, and that which is implied by the Apostolic
Epistles.&nbsp; The complete unworldliness, the quiet, elevated
self-denial, the earnest humility, the obedience on the one hand
and authority on the other, which are the evident characteristics
of practical Christianity as it appears in the inspired records,
are strikingly different from all which we see now in our popular
religion; and may at times well suggest the fear that we may have
lost much of that faith which the first Christians
possessed.&nbsp; And in no particular is this difference more
remarkably seen, than in the language held respecting the <span
class="smcap">Ministry</span> of the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>; which from its undeniable importance
deserves no light consideration.&nbsp; <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Of course it may be said, that much of
the difference of tone respecting the Ministry may be ascribed to
the &ldquo;cessation of apostolic authority strictly so
called.&rdquo;&nbsp; But however this be, which we pass for the
present, it is apparent to all, that there <i>is</i> a
difference: and so, men attempt to &ldquo;account for the
fact,&rdquo; rather than deny it.&nbsp; To account, for example,
for the &ldquo;magnified importance&rdquo; plainly attributed in
Holy Scripture to the living voice of an <span
class="smcap">Apostolic Ministry</span>, above and beyond, and
often without reference to other means of Christian
instruction.&nbsp; Not only the plea just mentioned, but other
similar ones are urged, as the &ldquo;change of
circumstances,&rdquo; the &ldquo;alteration in the times,&rdquo;
and the like, to account for the fact.&nbsp; How dangerous all
such arguments and evasions are, to those who seek a religion
exactly, or as nearly as possible, such as the first Christians
had, needs scarcely to be urged on any thoughtful mind.&nbsp; For
after all these suppositions and reasonings, it will still remain
very possible that <span class="smcap">The Ministry</span> first
Divinely set up in the <span class="smcap">Church</span>, was
<i>not</i> intended essentially to change with the changing
circumstances of this world; very possible that this might have
been given as one permanent if not paramount means of grace for
mankind, notwithstanding the subsequent introduction of other
means, however efficacious <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and invaluable.&nbsp; And then, the
actually existing ministry, its historical continuity, its
unconcealed pretensions, are facts not to be lightly set aside
when viewed in connection with this possibility only; even if it
were nothing more.&nbsp; How much of Apostolical grace is lost
from the ministry, it may be impossible to say; but so also it
would be equally impossible to say how much is retained.&nbsp;
Hence, it must ever remain the <i>safest</i> course for a
Christian man to adhere to an Apostolically descended
Ministry.&nbsp; Let us not pass too hastily from these thoughts;
let us follow them out, into minuter detail; in order to enter
into the state of mind apparently implied by language such as
that in the passage, for instance, which constitutes our
text.</p>
<p>Does it not here seem, by St. Paul&rsquo;s way of putting his
questions, leaving them, as it were, to answer themselves in
every Christian mind, that they could in his esteem admit of only
one answer?&nbsp; That they must conduct people to the inevitable
conclusion of the necessity of a <span class="smcap">Living
Ministry</span>?&nbsp; Modern Christianity would easily find
<i>other</i> replies; and does so practically.&nbsp; But is there
no danger in such a course?&nbsp; No danger in thus
<i>assuming</i> the sufficiency of what may be termed literary
methods of Christian instruction? <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>nevertheless it is certain, that very
often it <i>is</i> assumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How shall they believe
in <span class="smcap">Him</span> of whom they have not
<i>heard</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By reading the Bible and
judging for themselves,&rdquo; would be the reply of modern
Christianity.&nbsp; &ldquo;How shall they hear without a
preacher?&rdquo; asks the Apostle.&nbsp; And modern believers
might truly reply, &ldquo;We do not see the difficulty&mdash;Have
we not our Bibles in our hands?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How shall
they preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo; is the inquiry of St.
Paul.&nbsp; And, &ldquo;surely every man who understands his
Bible may teach it to another,&rdquo; might be the ready modern
reply.&nbsp; To the Apostle&rsquo;s mind, on the contrary, such
questions seemed to carry with them their own unavoidable
answers, establishing beyond controversy the necessity of an
authoritative publishing of the truth by living teachers, and
those duly sent
(&alpha;&pi;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&lambda;&omega;&sigma;&iota;):
nor does the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> of inspiration (to
whom every future change was known) here give any hint of the
future change of this system of teaching.</p>
<p>But further: what St. Paul meant by being &ldquo;sent,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;apostolically commissioned,&rdquo; as well as the high
importance which he attached to it, may be gathered from the
extreme anxiety with which, at the opening of his Epistles to the
Churches, he repeats, and dwells on, the fact of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>his own
apostolical character; which is so conspicuous, that the want of
such a preface has sometimes been urged as an argument against
his authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Paul an <span
class="smcap">Apostle</span> of <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>;&rdquo; &ldquo;Paul <span
class="GutSmall">CALLED</span> to be an Apostle, separated unto
the Gospel of <span class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; &ldquo;Paul
an <span class="smcap">Apostle</span> not of men, neither by
man,&rdquo; but &ldquo;by the will of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such are the beginnings of
his Epistles.&nbsp; Nor was such an anxiety at all unnatural in
him; because his apostolical character was not so regularly
derived as that of others, and had been greatly disputed in some
churches, and so needed constant vindication: of which the
Apostle seemed to be well aware.&nbsp; But, on modern principles,
this self-vindicating anxiety is quite unintelligible.&nbsp; It
never could have been manifested by St. Paul, if he had only
thought, &ldquo;that every man has a right to be a Christian
teacher, whether he has a mission or not, provided he is
persuaded of his own ability, and can persuade others of it
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; To one unacquainted with this notion, there
certainly would seem to be some powerful difficulty (which others
would not see) in this question, &ldquo;How shall they preach
except they be <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span><span class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
therefore in the next chapter to this which contains these
questionings, St. Paul again glances at this topic, and says,
&ldquo;Inasmuch as I am the Apostle (the <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span> one) of the Gentiles, I magnify mine
<span class="GutSmall">OFFICE</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, as we
have said, it is very easy to reply to all this, that St.
Paul&rsquo;s circumstances were different, and that that will
account for the difference of his feelings and language.&nbsp;
For even granting this, is it either consistent with a cautious
reason, or a Christian humility, to assume in this way, that we
are right in differing from St. Paul, provided we can
&ldquo;account for the difference?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, supposing
that our altered times do account for the difference (as in some
sense they do), does it follow that they justify it?&nbsp;
Perhaps we may &ldquo;account for&rdquo; most of man&rsquo;s
transgressions against <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
law, but does that <i>justify</i> them?&nbsp; But let us keep to
the case before us.&nbsp; How can we be so sure, that if in the
apostolic days the common people had possessed Bibles, and were
able to read them, and, in a word, were outwardly circumstanced
in all respects as we are, then St. Paul&rsquo;s principles, and
St. Paul&rsquo;s exhortations, would have been such as ours now
are?&nbsp; Have we any right to say, without proof, that St. Paul
assigned such an importance to the teaching of a living ministry,
<i>solely</i> because <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Bibles were not plentiful?&nbsp;
Might there not have been other reasons?&nbsp; Consider: is it
not very conceivable that there might have been that in
Christianity which could only be perfectly conveyed by an
institution such as the living ministry?&mdash;and which,
therefore, without that ministry, would not be attained, even
though men possessed every other means?&nbsp; Now, without saying
that it is so, and not insisting on the probability of it
(arising from the analogy <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> of God&rsquo;s past
dealings with mankind, and from the very nature of our social
condition), it is enough to affirm, that it is very
<i>possible</i>, very conceivable, that an apostolical ministry
might have been made by <span class="smcap">God</span> the
perpetual channel of a grace to man, which might be conveyed in
no other way.&nbsp; And the possibility of this ought for ever to
restrain us from the rash conclusion, that Christian blessings
may be sufficiently attained by private reading of the
Bible.&mdash;If any are inclined to such a conclusion, by the
consideration that possibly the apostolic ministry had a
miraculous blessing which no ministry had after the
Apostles&rsquo; age; so that language well suited to the first
generation of the Christian ministers, may not be suitable now;
it might be <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>answer enough to point out, that such a supposition
remains to be substantiated, and that it must be hazardous to
take up with a theory which incurs the risk of realizing <i>on
principle</i> only a defective Christianity.&nbsp; But more than
this may be briefly added, viz.: That as miraculous power was no
peculiarly apostolical prerogative (for all ranks of Christians
had possessed it), so neither can the want of it argue a
deficiency in apostolic grace and ministration; That the Apostles
associated with themselves Timotheus, Silvanus, Epaphroditus <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> and others, as possessing the same
<span class="smcap">Ministry</span> with themselves, though no
miraculous gift; and, That if the same ministry be not to
continue for ever in the church, then it would follow that
&ldquo;Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
world,&rdquo; has not been literally fulfilled; That the words of
Scripture which relate to the Church&rsquo;s Ministry, must not
be understood by us as they certainly were by the first
Christians, and, consequently, the plain sense of the Bible is
not our guide, as it was theirs so far as they possessed
it.&nbsp; And so, finally, our Christianity may be proved at last
to come short of the standard of Scripture, and be fatally
different in some important points from that which was originally
given to the world.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Nothing
which has now been said is intended to call in question the
reality of those blessings which <span class="smcap">God</span>
may and sometimes does bestow apart from His appointed means, or
by some only of those means apart from the rest.&nbsp; But enough
has surely been said to admonish men against that easy and
off-hand way of getting rid of those texts which imply high
apostolic power, by saying, that such passages only suit the
primitive days and the Apostles&rsquo; own ministry.&nbsp; On the
other hand, we would not pretend to decide how large an amount of
favour may be vouchsafed to those who have not the blessings of a
true priesthood.&nbsp; Cornelius, we know, was a just man, and
largely acceptable unto <span class="smcap">God</span>, before he
saw St. Peter, or received Christian baptism.&nbsp; Some, again,
of the earliest disciples had embraced the truth in some degree,
before they had heard &ldquo;whether there was any <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>,&rdquo; or had been baptized in
the name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&nbsp; And when the
Philippian Church was deprived of the ministry of St. Paul, they
were still admonished to rely on <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> in-dwelling <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> in the Church, and &ldquo;much more
in the Apostle&rsquo;s absence to work out <i>their own
salvation</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> may
dispense with His own appointed means, and may supply the lack of
them; but man cannot.&nbsp; But if it were right to compare, or
contrast, one of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> given
means of grace with another, it <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>might perhaps appear that none of
them are <i>so</i> essential as the Church&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">Ministry</span>, whereby all the rest seem to have
been instrumentally preserved.&nbsp; Much which we are too apt
think exclusively essential to the existence of Christian truth
and purity, had no being in the early Church.&nbsp; It is likely
that all essential means of edification would be given to the
first generation of believers; and, in fact, was not the most
exalted Christian grace possessed in the Church previous to the
Christian Scriptures?&nbsp; Whoever will reflect on these points,
will at least be prepared seriously to consider, what in
primitive days was understood by the ministerial mission to
teach,&mdash;what the meaning of St. Paul was in such terms as he
applied to the ministers of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?
(as that they were the &ldquo;sent&rdquo; servants,
&ldquo;stewards of mysteries,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">ALLOWED</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
and <span class="GutSmall">PUT IN TRUST</span> with the
Gospel,&rdquo;) and whether that may not be the true Christian
meaning still?&mdash;whether, notwithstanding the altered times,
there may not be as much meaning now as there ever was in the
question, &ldquo;How shall men preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> it may be rejoined, that there
are many who acknowledge the necessity of a Ministry in the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>, and who allow that it ought, in all
main particulars, to resemble that of the primitive <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Christians;
nay, who notoriously assign a very high value to such a ministry,
as a peculiar means of grace having a peculiar promise of
blessing annexed to it, and yet do not acquiesce in the Catholic
doctrine concerning it.&nbsp; And would it not be an unfairness
to charge such with setting-aside the apostolic ministry? or too
little esteeming it?&nbsp; Doubtless, it might be.&nbsp; But yet
this rather anomalous circumstance, that men who are generally
supposed to be somewhat lax, at least, respecting the subject of
an authoritative ministry, should also be often thought to give
undue prominence to &ldquo;the Sermon&rdquo; of a minister, even
beyond other means of grace; this, I say, only renders it the
more important that we should understand clearly what men mean by
a &ldquo;ministry&rdquo; in the Church,&mdash;what they consider
its real powers and chief functions,&mdash;and what its special
grace and blessing?&nbsp; For it can hardly be questioned, that
many think that they believe in a Christian ministry, when they
are only believing in a particular minister;&mdash;think that
they are believing in a <span class="GutSmall">MINISTRY</span>,
when they are only believing in eloquence.&nbsp; Many make free
use of words, when they would shrink from the ideas which they
naturally convey; and ascribe a degree of blessing to a ministry,
which in strictness of speech they would never think of seriously
attributing to <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>any such cause.&nbsp; And it cannot serve the interests
of truth to smooth over really different opinions, by generalized
expressions, just &ldquo;for the sake of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
truth is, there is the greatest possible vagueness of belief, or
rather opinion, respecting the Christian Ministry, in our times
and country especially.&nbsp; There is, perhaps very generally,
an indistinct impression, that <i>something</i> is required to
make a man &ldquo;a minister of the Gospel;&rdquo; but what it
is, very few would be ready to say: and this may be well looked
on as a sort of instinctive testimony of the human mind to the
felt truth, &ldquo;that it is not lawful for any man,&rdquo; on
the mere suggestion of his own thoughts, to stand forth as a
teacher of religion.&nbsp; Common sense seems thus to make the
inquiry, &ldquo;How shall they preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is felt universally, that a teacher of religion should have
some credentials.&nbsp; The most illiterate, indeed, will often
take the word of any man of outwardly respectable appearance, who
can manage, with the mixture of a few Scripture phrases, to talk
in an incomprehensible way, and look upon him directly as a
&ldquo;minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; The extent of this implicit faith
among some classes of sectaries is almost incredible to those who
have not personally witnessed it.&nbsp; But yet even these will
clothe their ministers with spiritual powers; <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and believe
their ministrations to convey a grace, and to possess a primitive
and apostolical value, such as those very
&ldquo;ministers,&rdquo; if pressed, would formally disown.&nbsp;
Hence many persons of these sects are violently shocked, when we
deny the validity of their sacraments as the sure channels of
God&rsquo;s grace; little thinking that their own ministers do
not <i>suppose</i> them to be so.&nbsp; And so also the multitude
of sects which flourished in this country during the time of the
Great Rebellion, owed much of their success to their unscrupulous
assertions of a &ldquo;divine mission;&rdquo; persuading the
people that theirs was the &ldquo;discipline of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>;&rdquo; and alleging a &ldquo;divine
right&rdquo; for every part of it.&nbsp; And yet, notwithstanding
this feeling planted in our very nature, that a spiritual
ministry must have a spiritual origin, it is astonishing to see
the facility with which almost any professed teacher is
received.&nbsp; Just as mere ignorance inclines the most
illiterate, so the better classes are induced, by indolence or
habit, to receive almost any man as a religious instructor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How their minister <i>became</i> a minister?&rdquo; is a
question which seems hardly to have occurred to the majority of
people.&nbsp; If a man has only ability enough to obtain a
congregation and a chapel, and especially if he assumes the
outward appearance and style of a clergyman, and is thought a <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;respectable man,&rdquo; nothing more is generally
inquired.&nbsp; But can this satisfy any one who thinks
seriously?&nbsp; The Bible describes the Christian Minister in a
very solemn way, as the &ldquo;Savour of life or death&rdquo; to
souls&mdash;as being an earthly vessel possessed of a
&ldquo;Heavenly <span class="GutSmall">TREASURE</span>,&rdquo;
the weight whereof he was not sufficient to bear! and so, to the
first Minister of the Church it was said, &ldquo;What <i>thou</i>
shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven;&rdquo;&mdash;Whatever this mysterious language implies,
are we to take a man to be all this on his own bare word? or on
the ground of his personal talents or sincerity?&mdash;Or can the
people&rsquo;s support of any man endow him with these awful
prerogatives of a Divine Ministry?&nbsp; Can a congregation,
however numerous, give what they themselves possess not?&nbsp;
Holy Scripture classes together <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> own <span
class="smcap">Mission</span> from His <span
class="smcap">Father</span>; and the <span
class="smcap">Apostles&rsquo; Mission</span> from <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Even the <span
class="smcap">Son</span> of <span class="smcap">God</span>
&ldquo;glorified not Himself&rdquo; to be made an High
Priest.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He</span> began not His
ministry till He was divinely pointed out at His baptism, and
from that time <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> began to
&ldquo;preach and to teach.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even He confessed,
&ldquo;As the <span class="smcap">Father</span> hath <span
class="GutSmall">SENT ME</span>,&rdquo; and, as &ldquo;the <span
class="smcap">Father</span> hath given <span
class="smcap">Me</span> commandment,&rdquo; even &ldquo;so I
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And His blessed Apostle said, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> was in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
reconciling the world unto Himself, . . . and hath <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span><span
class="GutSmall">COMMITTED</span> unto us the ministry of
reconciliation;&rdquo; and when the same Apostle was &ldquo;about
to be offered,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;time of his departure was at
hand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;This charge I <span
class="GutSmall">COMMIT</span> unto thee, son Timothy;&rdquo; and
further, &ldquo;the same <span class="GutSmall">COMMIT</span>
thou to faithful men,&rdquo; who shall <span
class="GutSmall">TEACH</span> others also.&nbsp; Indeed every
Scripture precedent is against the notion so wholly inconsistent
with the idea of a &ldquo;commission,&rdquo; that a man may teach
in the name of <span class="smcap">God</span>, without <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> authority so to do.&nbsp; Surely
the words of Scripture mean something.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pastors,&rdquo; &ldquo;stewards of mysteries,&rdquo;
&ldquo;overseers,&rdquo; &ldquo;embassadors,&rdquo;&mdash;those
&ldquo;in <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> stead,&rdquo;
those &ldquo;speaking in the person of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo; those whom the Churches were
commanded to &ldquo;obey&rdquo; as &ldquo;watchers for
souls,&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountable.&rdquo;&mdash;Those who were
received as &ldquo;angels of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; even &ldquo;as <span
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>;&rdquo; &ldquo;workers together
with <span class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; &ldquo;angels of the
Churches,&rdquo; &ldquo;stars in <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> right hand!&rdquo;&nbsp; Are
these the descriptions of an earthly dignity wherewith a man of
ability may clothe himself?&nbsp; Do they mean less than they
say?&mdash;or rather do they not powerfully point the question,
&ldquo;How shall men preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the vagueness of the popular creed, it is
not to be denied, that those <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>who think attentively about religion
and read their Bible with care, and yet embrace sectarian views,
have some way of explaining all these, and similar expressions,
so as to bring them, in some degree, into conformity with their
particular views.&nbsp; Doubtless some sort of explanation would
be <i>necessary</i> to give a measure of consistency to their
systems.&nbsp; And into the examination of their manifold systems
it would be impossible now to enter.&nbsp; Nor is it necessary;
it is enough to point out the fundamental error, of having a
system, and then &ldquo;explaining&rdquo; texts down to that
system.&nbsp; And this perhaps may be sufficiently done by
glancing chiefly at two classes of the most received theories,
with a view of showing that they alike proceed on a common
principle, and that (in consequence) instead of taking the words
of Scripture as they plainly stand, and accepting them as the
Church does, in their full natural meaning, they are obliged to
&ldquo;explain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such, indeed, we have already said
to be our running argument.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would the sectarians, or
would Catholics, have been more likely to employ naturally such
and such words?&rdquo;&nbsp; And more than this we can scarcely
attempt on this occasion.&nbsp; Indeed a formal confutation of
many such systems as we are now alluding to, would be almost
impossible.&nbsp; There is something so indeterminate about them,
that <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>there
is no tangible point of attack.&nbsp; The bare denial of an
Apostolically descended Ministry is, frequently, all that can be
obtained from our opponents.&nbsp; And where we are not presented
with this sort of vacuity of belief, we still meet with nothing
more than some thin theory of a <i>possible</i> ministration,
whereby a straining ingenuity attempts to harmonize its own
opinions with the facts and statements of Scripture; as if we
were set to inquire&mdash;what <i>may</i> be, or <i>might be</i>
a system of religious teaching? and not rather, what was from the
beginning?</p>
<p>One theory of a Christian ministry maintained, with more or
less of distinctness, by very many, is, that none are rightly
&ldquo;sent,&rdquo; or commissioned to teach <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> religion, unless they have
what is termed an &ldquo;inward call.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, if they
mean by this, that every minister of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> ought to be inwardly impressed with
the importance of his calling, no one will question it: but they
must mean more than this, or their meaning amounts to
nothing.&nbsp; Their idea seems to be, that no man has a right to
become a &ldquo;minister,&rdquo; who has not some overpowering
personal conviction of his spiritual destination to the
ministerial office, and that this is a sufficient evidence of a
true &ldquo;call&rdquo; to the office; and in conformity with <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>this notion
they explain every text.&nbsp; Now if any one imagines that he
has such evidence of a call within him, it is useless to reason
with him.&nbsp; He is clearly beyond that.&nbsp; If he can so
persuade himself, he may also persuade himself that all Scripture
is on his side; or any thing else.&nbsp; Few, indeed, will be
disposed to envy the venturous self-confidence of one who could
thus stand forth (with eternity before him) and on his own sole
authority profess, &ldquo;I am an embassador for <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am a
&lsquo;savour of eternal life and death!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Not
to dwell, too, on the opening thus given to fanaticism of every
kind, it is certain also that a man&rsquo;s personal conviction
can be no evidence to others; and yet others are interested in
the matter.&nbsp; How far his apparent religious success may be
so, is another question, which had better be separately examined,
and which we shall hereafter consider.&nbsp; But, it is plain, as
we have said, and again insist, that a man&rsquo;s personal
conviction alone is no sufficient proof for <i>others</i> that he
is &ldquo;sent&rdquo; to preach Christianity.&nbsp; The Apostolic
Epistles, every where, imply as St. Paul does in his question to
the Roman Church, that the being &ldquo;sent&rdquo; was a matter
which other men could judge of.&nbsp; It is certain, too, that
the Apostles had something <i>more</i> at least than an
&ldquo;inward call.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were, according to the
Scriptures, <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span><i>outwardly</i> called, from the very first, by <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself.&nbsp; And St. Paul, the only
one who was not so, was outwardly called, afterwards, by an
express miracle.&nbsp; So that the Bible, and Apostolic example,
are alike against the notion of the sufficiency of an inward
call.&nbsp; And here it may be collaterally remarked, that, least
of all men, can the members of our Church admit this, at the best
inadequate, doctrine; for the 23rd Article is emphatically
against it.&nbsp; It reads thus:&mdash;&ldquo;It is not lawful
for any man to take upon him the office of public preaching, or
ministering the Sacraments in the congregation, before he be
lawfully called and <span class="GutSmall">SENT</span> to execute
the same.&nbsp; And those we ought to judge lawfully called and
sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have
public authority given unto them in the congregation, to call and
send ministers into the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>
vineyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Above all, therefore, the man who holds
this doctrine of our Church will see a force which the advocates
of the inward call cannot understand in St. Paul&rsquo;s
question, &ldquo;How shall men preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But another notion concerning the Ministry, practically
entertained to a very wide extent is, That the Government of a
country has the <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>prerogative of making Ministers of Religion.&nbsp; That
this revolting opinion could possibly prevail in a Christian
land, is, perhaps, one of the most fearful proofs which could be
brought of Pagan ignorance, among nominal believers.&nbsp; And
yet, under various modifications, it prevails to an extent
scarcely credible.&nbsp; What but this is implied in the
expression which we often hear even educated people make use of,
&ldquo;that the State makes Bishops?&rdquo;&nbsp; What but this
is implied in our quiet acquiescence in the notion, that an act
of the State may abolish some of our bishopricks?&nbsp; What but
this is the ordinary practical interpretation of the phrase,
&ldquo;the Church as by law established?&rdquo; which sometimes
is even cast at us as an acknowledgment that our Church&rsquo;s
origin is an Act of Parliament.&nbsp; Is it not true, that many
have no other idea of a clergyman, than that he may be better
educated, perhaps, than some other teachers, and so is
&ldquo;patronized by the State?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, is this the
idea of a minister of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> which the
Bible would give?&nbsp; Is it a doctrine of the first Christians,
that men, simply because they are governors, and happen to have
civil power, may clothe their fellow men with the awful
prerogatives of a Spiritual Mission?&nbsp; Is it a doctrine of
the Church of England&mdash;when our Article expressly denies to
kings all spiritual <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>authority&mdash;and when Queen Elizabeth allowed the
oath of supremacy to be taken, with an accompanying declaration
to that effect?&mdash;It is easy, of course, to construct a
theoretical argument to prove, &ldquo;That the governor of a
State is bound to provide religious instruction for the
people,&rdquo;&mdash;but certainly such an argument will not
prove that the civil governor can give to any man a spiritual
<span class="GutSmall">AUTHORITY</span>.&nbsp; It can only prove,
that it is his duty to seek for a rightly authorized and
commissioned instructor, and give him the <i>additional</i>
worldly advantage of a legal sanction and defence.&nbsp; It may
be, that governors should look for and <i>find</i> a religious
teacher for the people&mdash;but they cannot <i>make</i>
one.&nbsp; Governors must be instructed and saved by the same
heavenly means as the people; and neither can rightfully
intermeddle with the administration of Divine things.&nbsp; On
the leprous forehead of King Uzziah we may read the presumption
of those who will so invade the sacred office. (2 Chron. xxvi.
19.)&nbsp; But it would be impossible to draw out more minutely
in this place <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> the arguments either for or against the
Erastian theory; and we are chiefly concerned to show that it is
wholly inconsistent with Scriptural and Primitive <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>doctrine,
which taught, that men should &ldquo;give unto C&aelig;sar the
things that are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s; but unto <span
class="smcap">God</span> alone the things which are <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The argument which
we would, again and again urge, is, Whether the notion of the
State commissioning the religious instructor is in harmony with
the language of the New Testament?&nbsp; Does not the Christian
mind at once revolt from the thought, That a ruler of this world
can commission any as embassadors of the world&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>?&nbsp; That the government of any
country can by their state-licence empower a man to &ldquo;bless
in the name of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>?&rdquo;&mdash;to be a
&ldquo;steward&rdquo; of Holy mysteries?&mdash;to absolve
penitents,&mdash;and &ldquo;deliver to Satan&rdquo; the
ungodly?&nbsp; Such was the Minister of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> according to Primitive belief and
Scriptural statement; acting &ldquo;in the person of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo; and marking with holy
indignation any who refused to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; in his
steps.&nbsp; He &ldquo;fed the flock of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; took &ldquo;the oversight of
them,&rdquo; and &ldquo;stirred up the gift that was within
him&rdquo; by the laying on of hands.&nbsp; These are the very
words of Scripture, and they, surely, never would have been
thought of, never could have been naturally used by the inspired
writers, if they had entertained the thought, that the State
could make a man a Christian Minister.</p>
<p>And such a thought certainly was not entertained <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>by the
Christians of the first 300 years, any more than by the Apostles;
who were not even countenanced by governors, but in things
spiritual &ldquo;resisted unto blood,&rdquo; and were charged
with &ldquo;turning the world upside down,&rdquo; rather than
submit to men in aught that pertained unto <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Even as late as the fourth
century, the great president of the Nicene Council thus declared
to the Emperor the Christian doctrine: <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a> &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span>
has put dominion into your hands.&nbsp; To us He hath entrusted
the government of the Church; and as a traitor to you is a rebel
to the <span class="smcap">God</span> who ordained you, so be
afraid on your part, lest usurping ecclesiastical power you
become guilty of a great sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again:
&ldquo;Meddle not with Church matters; far from advising us about
them, rather seek instruction from us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember that you are a man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear the
day of Judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; And nothing can be plainer than the
language addressed by St. Hilary to the Arian bishops.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O ye bishops, I pray you, what suffrages did the Apostles
make use of?&nbsp; Did <i>they</i> receive their dignity from the
palace?&rdquo; <a name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; And, after all, this is the
unanswerable argument.&nbsp; St. Paul was not received as an
Apostle, <i>because</i> he was allowed to preach to
&ldquo;C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. Luke was
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>not
admitted as a Minister simply because he was an educated
man.&nbsp; We do not find the enquiry in Scripture or antiquity,
How shall men preach except they be &ldquo;respectable?&rdquo;
or, how shall they preach except they be favoured by the State?
or, how shall they preach except they have literary
distinctions?&nbsp; Necessary and useful as all these
qualifications may be, the distinctive question concerning the
Ministry is, &ldquo;How shall men preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we before observed, that the popular notions, such as
these just considered, concerning the Christian Ministry, seem,
with all their variations, to be the result of a common
principle.&nbsp; The principle, that is, of reducing Christianity
to a bare code, or system, of intelligible precepts or
dogmas.&nbsp; And the advocates of these various notions are
obliged, in some way, to lay out of consideration whatever they
meet with, in Scripture or elsewhere, which is inconsistent with
this principle.&nbsp; The further development of these remarks
may serve more clearly to elicit, and by contrast elucidate the
Catholic doctrine of the Ministry.</p>
<p>The advocates, for example, of the &ldquo;inward call,&rdquo;
seem generally to regard <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> religion <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>as a code of
doctrines; while the maintainers of a government call, i.e. the
Erastians, regard it chiefly as a code of morals.&nbsp; They both
&ldquo;simplify;&rdquo; they both systematize; and their systems,
as such, proceed on very similar grounds.&nbsp; The former system
would naturally consider all things subsidiary to what is called
&ldquo;the application&rdquo; of the revealed doctrines to
individuals.&nbsp; Whatever agency seems calculated most
powerfully to bring home the doctrine to the mind of a man, that
is the most desirable; and with a reference to this, and <i>as so
viewed</i>, every thing in Scripture is forthwith
explained.&nbsp; Thus: Are Christians commanded in Scripture to
be <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span>?&nbsp; This system
interprets it to mean, that they must have one general
&ldquo;doctrine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are we said to be united to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> as &ldquo;members&rdquo; to a
body?&nbsp; This system calls it a &ldquo;metaphor,&rdquo;
designed only to inculcate charity and kindness.&nbsp; Are we
said to be saved by the &ldquo;washing of water?&rdquo;&nbsp;
This system tells us to understand it &ldquo;spiritually:&rdquo;
for &lsquo;that the water only represents the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a word, it simply
regards Christianity as a divine mental philosophy; and only
values the visible Church as a useful means, in such proportion
as it effectually &ldquo;applies&rdquo; this to
individuals.&nbsp; Of course there are countless varieties of
this species of religion, yet they agree in this, that they all
regard it as an <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>abstract code of principle, and whatever they find in
the Bible beyond this, they bend to their system in one way or
another.&nbsp; Calvinists, Semi-calvinists, Arminians, and
Pelagians, all seem to believe in a kind of essence of
Christianity, the existence of which in an individual is to be
tested by his possession of a sort of religious sense, to which
religious sense they indiscriminately apply every expression of
Scripture concerning the various states of the true
Christian.&nbsp; Accordingly the possessor of this sense is
&ldquo;regenerated,&rdquo; &ldquo;elect,&rdquo;
&ldquo;enlightened,&rdquo; &ldquo;renewed,&rdquo; &ldquo;born
again&rdquo;&mdash;and whatever else they can
&ldquo;accommodate&rdquo; in any verse of the Bible.&nbsp; A new
and intangible meaning is found for every term; every thing must
be sublimely doctrinal.&nbsp; The very precepts of Holiness are
looked on as &ldquo;consequences,&rdquo; which need not,
therefore, be too formally insisted on.&nbsp; The Sacraments of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> are &ldquo;elevated,&rdquo; or
extenuated, into &ldquo;shadows,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;signs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church itself is evaporated into
an &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; essence!</p>
<p>The other system, that of the Moralist, is rather more
difficult thus to maintain and adapt to Scripture.&nbsp;
Considering Christianity as a sort of republication of the law of
natural morality, with, perhaps, the announcement of the
necessity of repentance, and the assurance of consequent
forgiveness <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>with the <span class="smcap">Deity</span>; all beyond
this is regarded as mere enthusiasm.&nbsp; The defenders of this
system would allow the existence of a Ministry to be exceedingly
&ldquo;useful,&rdquo; and so come to think it the duty of the
State to support it.&nbsp; These, like the former class, would
maintain a visible Church, because it is &ldquo;useful;&rdquo;
and so they themselves will go to Church, they tell us,
&ldquo;for example&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; These, if they are
a little educated, soon become Socinians, <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a> and find it necessary to attribute
something much less than inspiration to the Bible, and so avoid
its plain testimony against their system; and then their course
is a very plain one.&nbsp; Those of the party who are more
ignorant, are generally found lulled in a complete religious
torpor, from which it seems almost impossible to wake them; for
if disturbed they only shut their eyes the closer, and more
inflexibly, as if it were the duty of &ldquo;plain
Christians,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sound old Churchmen,&rdquo; to
understand nothing.</p>
<p>Now in contrast to these and all other simplifiers of the
Catholic truth, we neither would attempt on the one hand, to
reduce the Bible to a code of <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>spiritual principles, nor on the
other to reject spirituality altogether as extravagance.&nbsp;
Consequently we have no need to get rid of any part of Scriptural
truth, either by &ldquo;explanations&rdquo; or
&ldquo;criticisms.&rdquo;&nbsp; We see that Scripture does
declare spiritual doctrines, and that it does enforce practical
morals.&nbsp; But we see much more than this in the Bible; for we
take it all literally, and plainly.&nbsp; We think that the
Scripturally recorded means, for applying the grace of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> religion are just as divine,
and therefore, for aught we know, just as essential, as either
the doctrines or precepts of that religion.&nbsp; Neither those
doctrines nor precepts may be rightly received, except in
connexion with, and as parts of, the <span
class="GutSmall">WHOLE</span> Divine Revelation; and of this the
means of heavenly grace included in the Church, are an undoubted
portion.&nbsp; Indeed what may be called the <span
class="smcap">Doctrine</span> of the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>, may be seen in a manner to
comprehend every other, so that even the truth of the Ministerial
Succession is but a part of that <span
class="smcap">Doctrine</span>.</p>
<p>It is very easy to mystify a plain subject, and <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>to represent
that the word <span class="smcap">Church</span> is of doubtful
meaning; but let any reader of the Bible answer this
question:&mdash;When St. Paul wrote a letter to &ldquo;the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> of Philippi,&rdquo; was there any
difficulty in deciding whom he meant to address?&nbsp; It is
plain that there existed in that city a number of families <span
class="GutSmall">BAPTIZED</span> in the name of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; and that number was ruled over by
certain spiritual officers; and, as a whole, was called <span
class="smcap">the Church</span>.&nbsp; Wherever, then, we find a
similar body of men, we say, there is a Church.&nbsp; Now, we
believe that such bodies of men, so organized, and constituting,
in the aggregate, the Church Universal, or Catholic, must exist
to the end of the world; because, at the very time when <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> promised to set up such an
institution, He promised to it a perpetuity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
build My <span class="smcap">Church</span>;&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
All this we believe simply as it stands, putting no invisible
meanings upon it.&nbsp; Wherever, indeed, we meet with a
spiritual truth, we receive it; but we desire not to make or
imagine one where it exists not, just to carry out an hypothesis
of our own.</p>
<p>We know that the spiritual rulers of the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> were made so at first by <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> personally, and that all the members
of the <span class="smcap">Church</span> were made so in one way,
namely, by Baptism. <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>(Gal. iii. 27.)&nbsp; We think that to the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> alone the peculiar promises of the
Gospel were made. (2 Peter i. 4.)&nbsp; We believe that there was
an awful power lodged in the <span class="smcap">Church</span>,
and exercised from the beginning, through her Rulers, a power
which, for example, could exclude unworthy members from
Communion, and that those so excluded were cut off from the <span
class="smcap">Church&rsquo;s</span> peculiar blessing. (Matt,
xviii. 18.)&nbsp; We think that how much soever Excommunication
might now be called a &ldquo;form,&rdquo; it was no mere form in
the Apostles&rsquo; days. (1 Cor. v. 5; Gal. v. 12; 1 Tim. i. 20,
and v. 20.)&nbsp; We look with reverence therefore on the powers
of the <span class="smcap">Church</span>, in her Ministers.&nbsp;
We dare not hastily pronounce any thing to be &ldquo;a mere
matter of discipline&rdquo; or &ldquo;only a form,&rdquo; because
we feel that we are ignorant of the mysterious ways of <span
class="smcap">God</span>: and none can determine the limit which
separates Divine Doctrine and Discipline.&nbsp; In fine, we look
upon the <span class="smcap">Church</span> herself as One Eternal
<span class="smcap">Sacrament</span>: the One great outward and
visible Institute, set up by <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
conveying to its members His invisible grace, through many
consecrated channels.</p>
<p>The permanent continuance of this One <span
class="smcap">Church</span> on earth we see to have been, in
point of fact, connected, from the beginning, with One permanent
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Ministry
or Priesthood, with which, at the first, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> the great High Priest promised to be
virtually present &ldquo;to the end of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
that, as it was promised that the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> should never be prevailed against; so
also that Ministry which was essential to it, should never
cease.&nbsp; To the <span class="smcap">Church</span> we know the
New Testament was addressed: and by the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> (with all other means of grace) it
was preserved.&nbsp; By the <span
class="smcap">Church&rsquo;s</span> instrumentality we,
individually, are brought to that Font where the &ldquo;stewards
of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mysteries&rdquo;
received us to the mystic body of the faithful.&nbsp; By the
<span class="smcap">Church</span> we really are taught in the
truth; for notwithstanding every boast of independent thinking,
the <span class="smcap">Church</span> is practically to us, what
it was to the first Christians, &ldquo;the pillar and ground of
truth.&rdquo; (1 Tim. iii. 15.)&nbsp; From the <span
class="smcap">Church&rsquo;s</span> voice we learn even the
lessons of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; And not only the transmitted
Wisdom, but the transmitted Grace of Christ is thus ours; for the
<span class="smcap">Church</span> is the &ldquo;fulness of Him
that filleth all in all!&rdquo; (Eph. i. 23.)&mdash;On our head
the <span class="smcap">Church</span> directs that holy hands be
laid.&nbsp; In the <span class="smcap">Church</span> we obtain
that grace, whereby we go on &ldquo;from strength to
strength:&rdquo; and in our partaking of the mysterious Sacrifice
which &ldquo;showeth forth the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> death,&rdquo; glory is given
&ldquo;unto <span class="smcap">God</span> in the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span><span
class="smcap">Church</span>, by <span class="smcap">Christ
Jesus</span>, throughout all ages.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay we doubt not,
that even &ldquo;unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
places there is made known by the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> the manifold wisdom of <span
class="smcap">God</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the Catholic faith.&nbsp; We trust in <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;we rely on His word, and His
appointments; as being anxious to recognise His presence among
us, as really and truly as the Holy Apostles did, when their
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> stood visibly before them and
said, &ldquo;Lo! I <span class="GutSmall">AM WITH YOU</span>
always!&rdquo;&nbsp; And it may safely be left to any man to
judge, how far these thoughts and feelings are in harmony with
the literal word of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Every
one may see that <i>we</i> have nothing there to explain
away&mdash;nothing to &ldquo;account for.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is such
as we might have written ourselves, so far as the sentiments are
concerned, to the full extent that those sentiments may be
apprehended.&nbsp; How simple and natural to us sounds the
injunction, &ldquo;Obey them that have the Rule over you, for
they watch for your souls!&rdquo; and how awkward, to say the
least, when spoken of self-sent teachers, or those whom the
people have commissioned and
&ldquo;called.&rdquo;&mdash;Believing that the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> is the perpetual depositary of those
awful gifts, which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> gave to men
when He &ldquo;ascended up on high,&rdquo; knowing <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>that He gave
some Apostles, &ldquo;some prophets, some pastors, and
teachers,&rdquo; for the perfecting of the saints, &ldquo;till we
all come in the Unity of the faith, . . . unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Not doubting that these,
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> gifts, have remained
and ever shall remain in His <span class="smcap">Church</span>;
with what thoughts must we regard the <span
class="smcap">Church&rsquo;s</span> Ministry!&nbsp; How can
<i>we</i> feel the thrilling solemnity of St. Paul&rsquo;s
exclamation, after he had absolved the Corinthian penitent,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Such trust</span> have we through
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> to <span
class="smcap">God</span>-ward!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Such trust</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;words may not
describe it&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Such
trust</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;not that we are sufficient of
ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves, but our sufficiency
is of <span class="smcap">God</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">WHO</span> also hath <span class="GutSmall">MADE
US</span> Ministers of the New Testament!&rdquo;&nbsp; What depth
of meaning to us is there in such language as, &ldquo;Feed the
flock of <span class="smcap">God</span> over whom the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost hath made</span> you
overseers!&rdquo;&nbsp; We feel that we are using it in the
Apostle&rsquo;s divine sense&mdash;yes, the very same solemn
sense!&nbsp; All systematizers are obliged to put some lower
diluted meaning upon it!&nbsp; And not on this alone, but on
every similar text of the Sacred Word!&nbsp; Which of them can
say, in the same sense as the Apostles did, of the Ministers of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, that they are &ldquo;Workers
together with <span class="smcap">God</span>?&rdquo;&mdash;Let
any man revolve in his mind all those words so copiously quoted
already, concerning the <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>unearthly responsibilities of those
who have to &ldquo;save themselves, and them that hear
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let a man deeply think of his <span
class="smcap">Saviour&rsquo;s</span> words, &ldquo;I give unto
you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,&rdquo; &ldquo;He that
heareth you heareth Me,&rdquo; and he will feel it strange
mockery, to apply such language to a minister self-authorized, or
commissioned by civil governors; and he will come to feel, as the
believers in an Apostolic Ministry feel, the power of the
question; &ldquo;How shall men preach except they be <span
class="GutSmall">SENT</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having now thus far explained the nature of the Catholic
Doctrine of the Ministry; not attempting to prove it by
theoretical arguments, but simply to contrast it with other
doctrines, and compare it with Scripture; it remains for us, next
to consider the means whereby this Ministry hath been continued
in the Church; and for this purpose we must state the Doctrine of
the <span class="smcap">Succession</span>.&nbsp; The Evidences of
the doctrine, and the Objections urged against it, we must
reserve to the following lectures.</p>
<p>It is affirmed, that before the Apostles quitted the field of
their earthly labours, they appointed &ldquo;Successors;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;laying their hands&rdquo; on them, transmitted all the
Apostolical power which they <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>had received from <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; It is not supposed that the
gift of Apostolical Ordination contained necessarily any such
grace, as is ordinarily understood by the term miraculous; though
many who were ordained at first, might of course have possessed
likewise such miraculous gifts, as were very common to all
classes of believers in the early Church.&nbsp; It is also on
record, that the ordained Successors of the Apostles, before
<i>they</i> also died, bequeathed their power and authority to
others, by the same ceremony of &ldquo;laying on of
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is not denied by any, that the same
practice has universally prevailed from that time to the
present.&nbsp; These Apostolical Successors throughout the whole
Church, were deemed the centres of Unity, and sources of
Sacramental grace to their respective communities, dioceses, or
Churches.&nbsp; They were looked upon as Chief Embassadors of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;Vicegerents of the <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> of mankind&mdash;all, in a word,
which St. Peter and St. Paul claimed to be:&mdash;Divinely
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sent</span>.&rdquo; (1 Tim. i. 12, ii.
7.)&nbsp; They were at first called by various
names,&mdash;Apostles, Superintendents, Angels, and Bishops; but
eventually this latter designation prevailed.&nbsp; From these
Bishops every other officer of the Church derived his power, and
&ldquo;without the Bishop,&rdquo; to use the words of St.
Ignatius, the contemporary of the Apostles, it was not lawful to
do <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>any
thing in the Church.&nbsp; Finally, for more than a thousand
years there was no Church in all the world which was not so
governed by Apostolically descended Bishops.</p>
<p>Such is an outline of the Doctrine of the Succession.&nbsp; A
minuter consideration of its details will necessarily follow on,
when we investigate the <span class="smcap">Evidence</span>, in
our next lecture.&nbsp; The solemn consequences of the Doctrine
itself, are such as may well dispose us to approach the
examination with all seriousness of soul.&nbsp; For on the one
hand, if we reject the Succession, it follows, that we have not
left on earth any real Ministry of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; while if we admit it, we admit it
with all its exclusive claims.&nbsp; Hard things may be said of
the choice of such a subject, and the revival of such an inquiry,
but the overwhelming importance of it will be a sufficient
vindication to every reflecting mind seeking for truth.&nbsp; The
time is come when questions like these may not be suffered to
remain undecided.&nbsp; When Romanism has advanced so rapidly
among us, making boast of its exclusive Apostolic claims, dare we
be silent?&nbsp; If we will care not to show our people our
Divine claims on their spiritual allegiance, can we wonder that
they revolt to Rome?&nbsp; Might we not expect the very
&ldquo;stones to cry out against us?&rdquo;&nbsp; In truth, <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>in very
truth, we have been silent too long!&nbsp; And the meagre
Christianity now prevalent on all hands, gives fatal evidence
against us.&nbsp; Christians seem to have forgotten that they are
already the members of an Eternal community!&mdash;Well may we
ask, Are these the elect of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&mdash;His chosen heritage?&mdash;with
the unseen wall of fire around them, and an uncared-for glory in
the midst?&nbsp; Yes, Christians seem almost wholly to have
forgotten their endowment of manifold gifts&mdash;almost
forgotten the &ldquo;taste of the good word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and the Powers of the world to
come,&rdquo; (Heb. vi. 4.) so that it may appear well nigh
impossible to &ldquo;renew them again to repentance!&rdquo;&nbsp;
But shall the Churches venture thus to await, without an effort,
the Second Coming of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>?&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span>
forbid!&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoso hath an ear to hear, let him hear what
the Spirit saith unto the Churches&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Remember</span> from whence thou art fallen! and
repent! and do the <span class="GutSmall">FIRST</span> works; or
else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy
candlestick out of his place, except thou <span
class="GutSmall">REPENT</span>!&rdquo;</p>

THE EVIDENCE.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">From the Gospel</span>. <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;It is written, <span
class="smcap">My</span> house shall be called the house of
Prayer.&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. xxi. 13.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> words may serve to suggest
some profitable reflections, preparatory to our entering on the
subject of the present lecture.&nbsp; They are the words of an
inspired prophecy, applied directly by our blessed <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself to the then existing temple of
the Jews.&nbsp; If we read them as they stand in the Old
Testament, among other glorious predictions concerning the
sanctuary of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Israel, we are naturally inclined to
expect some more illustrious fulfilment of them, than seems to
have been ever vouchsafed to the &ldquo;house of Prayer&rdquo; at
Jerusalem.&nbsp; The words of Isaiah (and the evangelist St. Mark
has more exactly quoted them) are, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">My</span> house shall be called an house of Prayer,
<i>for all people</i>;&rdquo; a prophecy apparently equivalent,
or nearly so, in magnitude to that of holy David, &ldquo;<i>all
nations</i> whom Thou hast <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>made shall <span
class="GutSmall">COME</span> and worship before Thee, O <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and shall glorify Thy
name!&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is very evident that this was never
realized in the fullest extent, with respect to the Jewish
Temple.&nbsp; Must we say then that the prophecy did not refer at
all to the literal temple in Judea?&nbsp; None, perhaps, would
venture so to affirm, seeing that our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself refers it to that temple.&nbsp;
Thus much however we are bound to conclude, that this example
shows us, how little we are able to decide beforehand what
amount, or kind of fulfilment, a Divine prediction may
have.&nbsp; And the fact, that our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> spoke of the temple, such it was then,
as <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> house, may serve also
to check any over-hasty accusations of total apostasy, in
consequence of extreme degeneracy among His people.&nbsp; It may
be useful here to premise this, because it is not unusual to
prejudice all enquiry, concerning the Catholic doctrine of the
Ministry of the Christian Temple, by a precipitate and
comprehensive assertion of its inconsistency with the
spirituality and dignity of the Divine designs; an assertion
generally supported by unmeasured charges of a corruption fatally
destructive of the Divine sanction, of the Sacred character of
any institute.&nbsp; Granting that the present state of the
Apostolically descended Ministry in the Church Universal, is very
far from what <i>we</i> should have <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>anticipated, from some of the
statements of Scripture, it would not follow, it seems, that
those statements are frustrated, but only that we had
misinterpreted them.&nbsp; It would not follow, that the Ministry
is not truly <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>, but only
that it needs His purifying.&nbsp; Our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> came to His temple of old, of which
such &ldquo;glorious things&rdquo; had been spoken, and He found
it a &ldquo;den of thieves,&rdquo; but still claimed it as His
own, in the glowing words of the prophecy, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">My</span> house shall be called the house of
Prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not the glorious pile that Solomon
had reared&mdash;it was not that which the returned children of
the captivity had built; and its Priesthood stood not forth
conspicuous for holiness.&nbsp; The beautiful courts of that
temple had been restored and rebuilt by the crime-stained Herod;
and they had been horribly polluted by violence and
outrage.&nbsp; The sanguinary story of the &ldquo;forty and six
years&rdquo; when that structure was building, is truly a lesson
full of melancholy warning! and when at last <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> came to the holy mount, He found
there a temple, well nigh built in blood and served by murderers;
and yet He began to &ldquo;purge it,&rdquo; and said of it, <span
class="smcap">My House</span>!&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">My House</span> shall be called the house of
Prayer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But do we say this to justify aught in the present <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>condition of
the Church Catholic?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> forbid!
for though we trust it is not so deeply fallen as was the Jewish
Church, &ldquo;our enemies themselves being judges,&rdquo; yet we
would not hide from ourselves our real state.&nbsp; But we bring
forward these words of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
the reflections that have thus arisen out of them, in order to
induce men to look calmly and fairly at the Evidence for our
Christian Ministry, not hastily prejudging the question, in
consequence of apparent moral and spiritual difficulties, (of
which they may be making a wrong estimate and use,) but simply
postponing, for a while, the objections which may be raised, and
separately and honestly looking at the proof and certainty of the
<span class="GutSmall">FACT</span> of <span
class="smcap">Apostolical succession</span>.&nbsp; Should it be
asked, Why we attach such importance to an institution, which,
even if real, seems to have accomplished so little? we reply,
That we pretend not to be able to estimate the workings or the
results of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> plans.&nbsp; It
is enough for us that they <i>are</i> <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>.&nbsp; And all we desire is, to
ascertain the fact.&nbsp; But we have something further, on which
our faith may repose.&nbsp; There are prophecies concerning <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Church, (and perhaps our text is
one,) which seem as yet to have had but little fulfilment.&nbsp;
Haply that is to be done to the Church at the second Advent,
which the purging of the temple, at the first Advent, only
prefigured.&nbsp; <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>It appears but little likely that that brief
significative act of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, from
which nothing seemed to follow, was the whole fulfilment of the
illustrious prophecy of Malachi concerning the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> &ldquo;Coming suddenly to His
Temple&rdquo; to purify it.&nbsp; It requires no proof that
<i>we</i> need such purifying.&nbsp; Is the main impression now
formed of the Christian temple&mdash;that it is a &ldquo;house of
Prayer?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is written, &ldquo;From the rising of the
sun to the going down of the same, My name shall be great among
the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered in My
name, and a pure Offering.&rdquo; <a name="citation45"></a><a
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; Hath this been
yet accomplished?&nbsp; That which is written shall surely come
to pass:&mdash;and on this our faith relies.&nbsp; And though
there be no signs of a present fulfilment&mdash;though we may be
told that &ldquo;thieves and robbers&rdquo; have made lawless
entrance, and that very little betokens a Divine presence&mdash;a
consecrated Priesthood or a &ldquo;pure Offering&rdquo; among us,
our faith is unmoved.&nbsp; A cleansing must come:&mdash;for
&ldquo;it is written, <span class="smcap">My</span> house <span
class="GutSmall">SHALL BE</span> called the house of <span
class="smcap">Prayer</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our last Lecture we attempted to show, that not a regularly
Succeeding Ministry, but rather a self-commissioned one, is the
really incredible <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>thing; and we endeavoured to give an outline of the
Catholic doctrine of the Succession.&nbsp; In proceeding now to
consider the Evidence of that Succession, we shall not dwell on
those traces of the doctrine and the fact which we think are to
be found in the New Testament: for several reasons.&nbsp; In the
first place, this has been so often and so fully done, <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46"
class="citation">[46]</a> that it would be a superfluous
labour.&nbsp; And then there is a felt unsatisfactoriness in all
such arguments.&nbsp; Scripture was not written critically, and
its terms were not precisely fixed; so that several of the sects
may and do build up plausible theories from passages of
Scripture.&nbsp; And again, what we have already shown, amounts
perhaps to all that is of any real value in any such arguments:
viz. that the Catholic doctrine is not only in perfect
<i>harmony</i> with every part of Scripture, but admits of a full
and literal interpretation of all its strongest and most solemn
language on this subject, in a manner which no sectarian doctrine
can pretend to.&nbsp; So far as Scripture then is concerned, we
feel no difficulty; and we now attempt no argument.&nbsp; Our
object is a very distinct one.&nbsp; Any man who reads the New
Testament, may see that it contains a &ldquo;doctrine of <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>laying on of
hands.&rdquo; (Acts xiii. 3, 4; 1 Tim. v. 22; Heb. vi. 2.)&nbsp;
Some may even perceive that the appointed and usual means of
transmitting Ministerial authority, was this &ldquo;Laying on of
hands,&rdquo; and that none had power to use this means save the
Apostles and those whom they authorized. (1 Tim. v. 22; 2 Tim. i.
6; Tit. i. 5.)&nbsp; Many a man may go so far as to admit the
fact, that no Ministry was received in the Christian Church for a
thousand years, and more, <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a> except that which
was commissioned through the Apostles and their reputed
Successors, the Bishops.&nbsp; And yet any such may still feel
difficulty in the question&mdash;something almost amounting to a
deficiency, at least, of clear Evidence.&nbsp; He may fairly be
harassed by doubts such as these: &ldquo;How am I to know after
all, that all these bishops from age to age were truly ordained
by a true Apostolic predecessor?&nbsp; Is it not both possible,
and probable, that in some places, for example, a powerful man
might have usurped authority in a Church, and made himself a
Bishop?&mdash;Or a learned man, in &lsquo;dark times,&rsquo; have
imposed on the ignorant?&nbsp; And if so, would not all his
Ministerial acts be worthless?&nbsp; And might not one such break
in the chain, at some early period, have invalidated all
subsequent Ordinations?&nbsp; Are there then any positive <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>proofs that
such has not been the case?&nbsp; Where are the documents?&nbsp;
What is the <span class="GutSmall">EVIDENCE</span> of the facts,
on which an intelligent man may rely?&rdquo; <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; All which questions are perfectly
fair, and deserve to be honestly entertained.&nbsp; And to these
(rather as connected with the fact than the doctrine) we address
ourselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps, indeed, there is a brief answer to them all, which
may at once satisfy many, better than a more tedious proof:
namely, that if the &ldquo;doctrine of laying on of hands,&rdquo;
and the transmitted Ministry, be received as contained in
Scripture, and taught ever by the Church, so the very same Holy
Volume contains also the promise that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would be with His Ministers to the
end of time; and He would therefore of course preserve to them
all that was in the least degree essential.&nbsp; The
faithfulness of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself would
thus be a mighty proof to the humblest Christian, that all that
Scripture inculcated as necessary to the Ministry, would truly be
preserved in the Christian Church, as much as it formerly was in
the Jewish.&nbsp; And he might also have this additional proof of
the fact, that no one (not even infidels) would attempt to <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>disprove
it.&nbsp; But we will now endeavour to go a little more narrowly
into the question, because it is frequently a stumbling block to
many.</p>
<p>Let a man begin by analysing his own thoughts, and satisfy
himself&mdash;first of all, what <i>kind</i> and <i>amount</i> of
evidence he requires of the fact, that every Bishop of an
Apostolic line was duly ordained by the &ldquo;laying on of
hands?&rdquo;&nbsp; Does he expect to see the very documents
written at the time,&mdash;and the seal and sign manual of those
who were present?&mdash;or, would that suffice?&nbsp; Perhaps
many may be disposed to think that such evidence must be
satisfactory to the most incredulous.&nbsp; But pause, and
consider: how should we know for certain that each separate
document was quite authentic?&nbsp; How could we be quite sure
that none were forged by some crafty monk during those mysterious
times, which some people, (as if excusing their own want of light
on the matter,) speak of as &ldquo;dark ages?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or,
suppose any one, or two, or three of the documents were destroyed
by all-corroding time? or had become illegible?&nbsp; What
then?&nbsp; Surely such evidence would be thought very unsafe to
rely on.&nbsp; Most persons would look with great suspicion on
such an array of unknown manuscripts, and look about for
something more satisfactory and possible.&nbsp; And <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>perhaps,
then, it might not be amiss to inquire what kind, or amount of
evidence it would be reasonable to look for?</p>
<p>Will it not be reckoned enough, if it should appear, that we
have as good evidence of the Succession of the Ministry from the
first, as we have of the reality of the institution of the
Sacraments? or of the authenticity of Holy Scripture?&nbsp; This
methinks will be enough at least for Christian men in general,
though it may not be satisfactory to every disputer; and if we
will attentively look into it we may certainly find the evidence
to be quite as strong as this.&nbsp; The very same objections
might be brought against the Apostolic Scriptures, the Apostolic
Sacraments, and the Apostolic Ministry.&nbsp; We have the same
kind of moral certainty of them all: and perhaps it might even be
argued, that the highest degree of such certainty, if a
difference could be admitted, pertains to the latter.&mdash;Thus
much, at least, must be apparent on a very little reflection,
that the kind and amount of evidence which some persons expect to
have given them, of the Apostolic Succession, is impossible in
the very nature of things, and exactly similar to the evidence
which uneducated people, when they first begin to inquire, expect
to find for the authenticity of the Bible, and <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>which
infidels craftily demand for all Revelation, well knowing that it
cannot, in the nature of things, be had.&nbsp; For, in the first
place, we can none of us have the same kind of certainty
concerning any fact transacted in our absence, as of what is done
in our presence; much less of any thing which happened in a
distant place, a foreign country, or before we were born.&nbsp;
And still less if it be removed farther back; as before our
fathers or great-grandfathers were born.&nbsp; Whoever,
therefore, undertakes to believe no farther than he personally
sees and knows, must suspend his faith in all history, and even
in the daily conversations and transactions of those around
him.&nbsp; And if any man is in this humour, we will not argue
with him about it.&nbsp; It is plain that these notions of strict
personal evidence for every thing must be abated, if we would
exercise our common sense.</p>
<p>Let us take the case of a man who begins to examine the claims
of the Bible to be received as the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Suppose him to be not very
learned; he is able at least to see that <i>his</i> Bible is like
other people&rsquo;s: and they, many of them being educated
persons, believe it to be <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
Word.&nbsp; This is something.&nbsp; And then it is the
Authorized Version, sanctioned by the Church <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>and the
State.&nbsp; And this is something more.&nbsp; And he sees that
even those who abuse the Church, are either very bad men, or if
they are sincere, well-meaning sort of people, and set up a new
Religion for themselves, they are obliged, after all, to make use
of the Church&rsquo;s Bible, and generally the Church&rsquo;s own
Translation.&nbsp; He therefore has even so far tolerable ground
for thinking that the Book which he has received as the Word of
<span class="smcap">God</span> is truly such.</p>
<p>Now we do not in the least question that all this, taken in
connexion with the Internal excellence of The Volume, is very
good evidence for the generality to rely on.&nbsp; It is just as
good as, or perhaps better than, they can get for any fact of
history, or common knowledge, or daily life.&nbsp; It is not
demonstration&mdash;but it is sufficient, probable
evidence&mdash;such as men take and act upon in every other
matter, without thinking it a hardship, or unsafe.&nbsp; And we
affirm that this is just the kind and amount of evidence which
any man in this country may have either for the Apostolic
Sacraments, or the Apostolic Ministry of the Church.&nbsp; He
knows that his Church is the Church of his forefathers; and that
they were baptized in it by her Ministers, before meeting-houses
were thought of; that the learned and the good have abounded in
it, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>as all
allow; and that even those who depart from it, generally retain
some similar outward forms both of Sacraments and Ministry,
though (consciously and candidly) they own them to be then
without any necessary grace in them.&nbsp; So that he regards his
Church as a <span class="GutSmall">FACT</span> borne witness to
on all hands; a sure and stable <span
class="GutSmall">REALITY</span>.&nbsp; Over and above all which,
there is an Internal evidence also of Catholic Truth, which the
humble and obedient surely possess at length. (John vii.
17.)&nbsp; For the Catholic Church teaches that the Baptismal
grace of Regeneration, if watered by prayer and holy teaching,
will at length expand into a certainty of persuasion of Her
sacred institutes, (Prov. iv. 18; 2 Tim. i. 12.) which heresy
will labour vainly to destroy.&nbsp; A blessed feeling, akin to
the indestructible reverence of a child for its Mother, from
whose lips the first words of prayer were learned, and the first
peaceful hopes of heaven.</p>
<p>But, going beyond this case, take that of a man who can enter
with sufficient care into the literary evidences of the truth of
the Bible.&nbsp; If skilled in its languages, he will go at once
to the printed editions of the originals.&nbsp; Then he must
inquire, from what manuscripts the received text was
printed?&nbsp; And he will find it stated, that that of the New
Testament, for instance, is one of about <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the year
eleven or twelve hundred.&nbsp; And for that fact he has to rely
on the critical skill of certain scholars and editors, some of
whom saw the manuscript, and thought it to be of that age.&nbsp;
But next comes the question: where are the <span
class="GutSmall">ORIGINAL</span> manuscripts?&nbsp; And it then
appears that they are <i>lost</i>.&nbsp; Then where are the
copies first taken? or even <i>soon</i> taken, from the
manuscripts? and it seems that these are <i>lost</i> too.&nbsp;
How then is he to prove that the manuscript from which our New
Testament is translated is a faithful copy of what was written
nearly eighteen hundred years before, and so unfortunately
lost?&nbsp; He has thereupon a laborious task before him.&nbsp;
He must trace, for instance, the various quotations in the
writings of the Fathers of the Church; and then compare them with
some early translations.&nbsp; In connexion with which, he might
observe the reverence with which Holy Scripture is always treated
in the primitive writings; and that the exact names of all the
Sacred Treatises are preserved alike, in various places.&nbsp;
And by pursuing these and kindred methods, he will at length
arrive at a strong probable conclusion as to the genuineness and
authenticity of the Holy Volume: a conclusion continually
accumulating in power and becoming at last morally irresistible,
and practically equivalent to a demonstration.&nbsp; He sees, in
fact, that <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>there are certain phenomena which can be explained by
one hypothesis, and one only, and that therefore that one must be
admitted.&nbsp; The actual state of Christian literature can only
be explained on the supposition of the existence of some such
Divine treatises as our New Testament at the close of the first
century.</p>
<p>Now all this examination of evidence, satisfactory as it is in
the result, is very far from being that easy and off-hand way of
&ldquo;proving the truth of the Scriptures&rdquo; which untaught
people vaguely imagine to be possible and even necessary.&nbsp; A
similar series of remarks might be made on the verification of
the Sacraments of the Church, as being the same as those
originally instituted by our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
ever practised by His people.&nbsp; But, passing now to our
immediate subject, it will not be difficult to see that the
Apostolicity of the Ministry, if fairly examined with equal
patience, admits of the <span class="GutSmall">SAME</span> kind
of proof, as either the <span class="smcap">Sacraments</span> or
the <span class="smcap">Scriptures</span> of the Church.&nbsp;
Indeed there scarcely seems a possibility of any traditive truth
being supported by stronger evidence than we have for the fact of
the Succession; so that if this be not true, it appears
impossible to say what proof we could ever have to substantiate
any such fact.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>So far
back indeed as any genuine general records of past events exist,
we may boast that our Apostolical records exist.&nbsp; So that
during these latter, which may be called the literary ages of the
world, we may trace the existing record of the Succession in our
principal dioceses for many centuries.&nbsp; But this is not the
kind of evidence which we could speak of, as so abundantly
satisfactory; nor could we esteem it so, even if it reached to
the Apostles&rsquo; days, and were cleared of all those doubts of
its genuineness, which we before alluded to. (page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page47">47</a></span>.)&nbsp; It
would not be satisfactory, for this simple, though little thought
of reason, namely, That a Succession of Bishops in one See, is
not and cannot ordinarily be, a succession of one and the same
Apostolical line.&nbsp; So that if, for example, we should
produce a list of every Archbishop of Canterbury to the very
first, who was consecrated by a French Bishop, and should then
add the name of every one that had preceded that French Bishop in
his see, up to the Apostles&rsquo; days, still we should not have
proved the existence of any One line of Apostolical
descent.&nbsp; No single line of Succession confined to a single
Church is possible.&nbsp; Every newly ordained Bishop in every
See comes of a new line; and that a threefold line, as we shall
presently notice.&nbsp; In addition to which, it should be borne
in mind, that the Succession was <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>transmitted in many lines, even from
the beginning.&nbsp; Endeavour to examine these points more in
detail.</p>
<p>We learn from Eusebius, that the Apostles selected various
parts of the world as the separate fields of their labour.&nbsp;
And wherever there was an Apostle, there was one who had the
power (which he did not neglect to use) of transmitting the grace
of the Ministry of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>;
consequently there must have been several lines of Ministerial
Succession from the first.&nbsp; Probably every Apostle ordained
some, as &ldquo;overseers,&rdquo; &ldquo;presidents,&rdquo; of
Churches; and so became an originator, not of one, but of
several, lines of Apostolical grace.&nbsp; If each of the Twelve
had ordained but one, there would still have been twelve such
lines Apostolical: but since the indefatigable Apostles doubtless
did much more than this, there must have been many Ministerial
lines, from the very first.&nbsp; We are putting ourselves
therefore in a very false position when, in arguing with
Romanists, we allow them tacitly to assume, as they seem to do,
that there was but one line of Apostolic Ministration transmitted
from the beginning.&nbsp; But this error will be more apparent by
examining farther.</p>
<p>Let us endeavour to look at the case both <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>historically
and practically, that so we may see not only its past, but also
its present bearings.&nbsp; In so doing we may be led to
understand its principle more clearly.&nbsp; When, at any time, a
Bishopric might become vacant in the Church, and a new Bishop was
to be consecrated thereto by the &ldquo;laying on of
hands,&rdquo; by whom was this solemn rite to be performed?&nbsp;
Take, for example, a Bishop of Antioch.&nbsp; He dies, and a new
one is to be consecrated.&mdash;Who is to do it?&mdash;Several,
probably, unite in &ldquo;laying hands on him&rdquo; with prayer
and fasting. (Acts xiii. 3.)&nbsp; Suppose one of them to be the
Bishop of Alexandria; then the next question must be&mdash;Who
consecrated <i>him</i>? and those who were his coadjutors at
Antioch?&nbsp; And it might take us to as many different Churches
to decide this point, as there were Bishops at that
consecration.&nbsp; By the laws and practice of the Church, <a
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a> it is necessary for three Bishops, if
possible, to be present and unite in the Consecration of every
new Bishop.&nbsp; Now suppose another of the three, in the case
just given, to have been a Bishop of Rome; then to trace the
Apostolical Succession we must proceed to ask, who consecrated <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>that Bishop
of Rome?&mdash;Not the previous Bishop of Rome; for he, probably
and almost invariably, would be dead before his Successor was
appointed.&nbsp; Then, of course it must needs be some foreign
Bishop, assisted by <i>two</i> others from different parts of
Christendom.&nbsp; And then the question would widen still
farther, as each of <i>their</i> ordinations would have to be
examined.&nbsp; And so the inquiry would have to proceed,
widening from Bishop to Bishop, and from Church to Church, till
we might arrive, if possible, at the first Apostolic consecration
of at least <i>one</i> of the long line, through which the
manifold grace had flowed.&nbsp; Except in the case of the
translation of a Bishop from one See to another (a practice
unsanctioned by primitive antiquity) it would never happen that
the <i>same</i> line of Succession would be at all continued in
any one Church, even during two succeeding Episcopates.&nbsp;
And, even in that case, it would be mingled with the Succession
of the two other Bishops, who had joined in the new
consecration.&nbsp; Hence a Succession of Bishops in any one
Church is <i>not</i> a Succession of the same spiritual line of
descent.&nbsp; Nay, if we had no more to allege than the line of
the Bishops of a particular Church, even though we could
enumerate them quite up to the Apostles, we should not have
proved <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>a
valid Succession.&nbsp; But rather the reverse; because it must
have been very possible that some one, or more, of the line might
have died suddenly, before the ordaining of the Successor; in
which case the Succession would be lost, unless some <i>other</i>
Church were applied to.&nbsp; It is plain that no particular
Church, whether in Constantinople, Canterbury, or Rome, can
pretend to possess an exclusive line of Apostolic grace.&nbsp; It
is plain that no Church can be strictly said to &ldquo;derive its
orders&rdquo; from another.&nbsp; And it only evinces a want of
thinking, for any man to say, for example, &ldquo;that such and
such a Church derives its orders from the Church of
Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every one must have observed the false
position in which English Churchmen have allowed themselves to be
put, by overlooking this simple point.&nbsp; They have thus
admitted, practically, that the Church of Rome had a private line
of Apostolical Succession, of which she could impart to
others!&mdash;forgetting that the Bishop of Rome himself is
necessarily indebted to the Bishops of three other Churches for
<i>his own</i> consecration. <a name="citation60"></a><a
href="#footnote60" class="citation">[60]</a>&nbsp; The Succession
is and <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>must be <span class="smcap">Catholic</span>, coming
through all the Bishops of the Holy Church throughout all the
world.&nbsp; And in this lies our security.&nbsp; Just as our
persuasion of the genuineness of the Scriptures arose, not from
our seeing the originals, or the earliest copies, but from the
united testimony and criticism of Christian men; so our
conviction of the validity and necessity of the Succeeding
Ministry results from a like Catholicity of testimony.&nbsp; Here
too, as with the Scriptures, we have unquestioned phenomena, (the
whole history of the Catholic world,) which can only be explained
by admitting the <i>fact</i>.&nbsp; The Church of Rome has no
more preserved our Orders, than she has our Bibles.&nbsp; And in
this fact lies our chief security, that no particular Church, in
Rome or elsewhere, has the Succession in its keeping, so as to be
able either to keep it, or fatally corrupt it; for it is <span
class="smcap">Catholic</span>.</p>
<p>And further: That very intricacy of the interwoven Catholic
line, which renders it so impracticable a thing to trace the
individual private Succession of any Bishop upwards to the
Apostles, gives it an amassed mightiness, and hitherto
uncalculated strength, when tracked downwards from the
beginning.&nbsp; The twelve Apostles began it, by ordaining the
first Bishops; and when in the very next generation the practice
became <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>established, of three Bishops assisting at every fresh
consecration, it was at once morally impossible to pervert, or
intercept the grace Apostolical.&nbsp; In the very next
generation any three Bishops who came to a fresh Ordination,
would each bring a three-fold Succession, so as to convey the
Grace which had flowed through nine different Churches.&nbsp; The
difficulty of failure would thence be still further augmented in
the next generation, and the next.&nbsp; And what would be even
at so early a stage, a moral impossibility, would needs go on
accumulating from age to age.&nbsp; So that if at any time by any
possibility, the Church&rsquo;s vigilance was defeated, and one
of the ordaining Bishops was of doubtful Apostolicity, there were
two more united with him, and so preserving the grace of the
institute. <a name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a>&nbsp; This was in accordance with the
very first of the extant Apostolical Canons, <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a> which enacts, &ldquo;Let a Bishop be
ordained by two or by three Bishops&rdquo; (and the larger number
was almost invariably required).&nbsp; The strictness with which
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>this was
kept up, is borne witness to alike by Fathers, <a
name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a> and Councils, and Historians, from the
very beginning.&nbsp; And if this were not unequivocally and
universally the case, (as it certainly is, so as to make
quotation and reference seem like affectation,) it would be easy
to bring abundant and overbearing evidence of another kind.&nbsp;
For the watchful care and pains of all the Churches in the matter
of Ordinations is just as notorious, as that Christianity existed
and prevailed in the world.&nbsp; The very faults of the early
Christians, no less than their virtues, contributed to secure the
Succession.&nbsp; Far indeed from lethargy were those
times.&nbsp; Abounding heresies, mutual jealousy, and religious
zeal, all combined to augment the Church&rsquo;s
watchfulness.&nbsp; And, above all, the vigilantly sustained
Discipline, by which the whole community was so interwoven, that
the greatest and smallest affairs of Christian concern were alike
communicated to the whole body.&nbsp; Not only would any new
ordination be known in each of the three Churches from which the
ordaining Bishops came; but it was very presently notified also
to the Metropolitans <a name="citation63b"></a><a
href="#footnote63b" class="citation">[63b]</a> by Episcopal
letters.&nbsp; <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>And beyond this, the election of a Bishop was a matter
well known, and publicly canvassed.&nbsp; It was not a thing
which (like the Canon of Scripture) might have been for a time
kept to themselves, by the learned.&nbsp; No, the common people
knew perfectly of the transaction.&nbsp; An infraction of an
Apostolic rule, even in a minor point, was clamorously echoed
from Church to Church, so that it was rarely ventured on; much
less would it be suffered in any important thing.&nbsp; Even evil
men in their day were obliged to conform to the outward rules of
the faithful; or they found an universal outcry against
them.&nbsp; The State had then nothing to do with the matter; and
the people (such was their temper and disposition) would have
thought of owning a heathen for a Bishop, as soon as a man not
duly ordained.&nbsp; Nay, there was even a holy emulation among
the Churches; in consideration of which we might in a qualified
sense, admit an additional kind of sacredness and certainty, so
to speak, in the Succession of those Episcopates, which were
noted for peculiar carefulness; as in the Ante-Nicene times that
of Alexandria appears to have been.</p>
<p>So was it from the first.&mdash;And in every subsequent <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>generation of
Christians, as we thus see, the intricacy of the Succession, and
consequently the difficulty of breaking it, would be more and
more intensely augmented; as if indeed utterly defying the
unfaithfulness or fraud of man to set it aside.&nbsp; Whatever
else has at any time been charged against the Catholic Church, it
has never been said, that she failed in duly Ordaining her
Bishops; and even if this could be shown, still a failure in one
part would not touch the rest. <a name="citation65a"></a><a
href="#footnote65a" class="citation">[65a]</a>&nbsp; To break up
the Succession of the Apostolic Ministry nothing less, indeed,
seems to be required than a self-destroying conspiracy of the
Church Universal.</p>
<p>We possess then all the Evidences of this illustrious fact,
which human testimony can furnish, or human industry bring
together.&nbsp; Universal witnesses to support it; and not one
against
it.&mdash;Scriptures,&mdash;Canons,&mdash;Councils,&mdash;Fathers,&mdash;and
Churches,&mdash;the learned and the common people&mdash;all
evidencing one thing; and even heretics and infidels not denying
it as fact;&mdash;a fact too, which they are forced to see has
gathered and still shall gather fresh mightiness, as centuries
roll on! <a name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b"
class="citation">[65b]</a>&nbsp; For on the heads of the present
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Bishops of
the Church Universal, there rests the concentrated grace of all
the Apostles.&nbsp; And this One Institute&mdash;the <span
class="smcap">Ministry</span> of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> now stands, <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> as at first Divinely set up, an abiding
monument of the truth, that <span class="smcap">He</span> who
determined by the &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; and
&ldquo;foolishness&rdquo; of preaching to save them that believe,
has manifested that the &ldquo;foolishness of God is wiser than
men, and the weakness of God stronger than men.&rdquo;&mdash;The
things which man in all his wisdom contrived, eighteen hundred
years ago, are departed like shadows.&nbsp; What <span
class="smcap">God</span> ordained remains, and shall &ldquo;till
the consummation of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would that the thought of this stupendous <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>grace might
ever dwell with each Bishop of the Church Universal, that those
words of promise which are the charter of the perpetuity, and the
power which Christ hath given might accompany them, as if ever
and anon spoken by a heavenly voice,&mdash;to elevate, console,
and awe their inmost spirit,&mdash;&ldquo;Lo, I <span
class="GutSmall">AM WITH YOU</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;Nay, what
thoughts of glory and majesty may well possess us all! when,
putting aside the thankless debates, and presumptuous
questionings of men, there rises before our mind&rsquo;s eye the
august vision of the &ldquo;whole family in heaven and
earth;&rdquo; existing as for ever <span class="smcap">One</span>
to The Omniscient <span class="smcap">Eye</span>, yet
mysteriously passing through the long and varying successions of
time, age after age; ministered unto throughout, by <span
class="smcap">One</span> succeeding Priesthood, <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> ever subsisting &ldquo;after the power
of an endless life,&rdquo; and so holding together all the
members of the eternal family, the living and the dead, in mystic
fellowship and communion, even reaching to a &ldquo;fellowship
with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Seems it not too great a thought for mind of man to take in, in
all its sublime fulness?&mdash;And has it not some holy
influence, forcing from us the exclamation of felt
unworthiness&mdash;&lsquo;Alas! for what we <i>are</i>,&mdash;and
what we <i>should</i> be?&rsquo;&mdash;It is <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>as if (with
earth&rsquo;s pollutions yet unwashed from our spirits) we were
borne upwards in vision even &ldquo;to heaven-gate,&rdquo; and
bidden by the Angel of an Apocalypse to look in, and see, though
from far, the eternal wonders, behold the forms of distant glory,
and feel, though but for a moment, the thrilling air of
heaven&rsquo;s own Holiness.</p>

Therefore, surely, it is a Christian thing to endeavour, now as
far as we are able, to remove such difficulties as obstruct the
faith of some, concerning the Ministry of the One Holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church: only premising that our object here is not
to prove the truth, but to facilitate its reception.&nbsp; The
truth of the <span class="smcap">Apostolical Succession</span>,
being confirmed by foregone proof, cannot, however, be affected
by the measure of our success in clearing up difficulties.</p>
<p>It would be a very vain waste of time to attempt to answer
many light and frivolous objections; for so far as they are
really stumbling blocks to any, they will soon be removed when
the doctrine itself is at all understood.&nbsp; Necessarily there
will seem to arise from time to time <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>numberless minor points which,
however, any man whose judgment is worth convincing would soon be
able to explain for himself.&nbsp; In such proportion as a man
apprehends the truth, or, if I may so express it, perceives the
spirit and scope of the Catholic Religion, he will come to see,
at a glance, the answer which, on Catholic principles, would be
given to such and such difficulties.&nbsp; This is the Divine
reward of an abiding humble faith.</p>
<p>The common and most influential Objections may admit of a
two-fold classification; according as they arise from certain
supposed difficulties in the Fact, and in its
consequences&mdash;or in the Doctrine, and its
consequences.&nbsp; And we will at once proceed to consider,
first, some difficulties thought to be historically and
practically connected with the Fact of the Succession, and its
consequences.</p>
<p>The Objection which requires, perhaps, the least trouble and
information to make, (and from its indistinctness is rather
difficult to grapple with,) and which, therefore, is more
frequently employed than any other, is founded on a charge of
general and fatal Corruption of Christianity in the middle
ages.&nbsp; Granting, it is said, the fact, that there was an
unbroken Succession of Bishops in the Church Catholic from the
beginning, still the gross <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>and palpable corruption which so
extensively pervaded the Church for ages, was quite sufficient to
rob the Succession of all spiritual value.&nbsp; Now this wide
and gratuitous assertion might fairly be met by asking the
objector&mdash;how he comes to know this?&mdash;How he comes to
be so sure that personal human corruption would wholly obstruct
the super-human grace of a Divine institution?&nbsp; How he
arrives at such a certainty that the grace of <span
class="smcap">God</span> is not mightier than the sin of
man?&nbsp; How he <i>can</i> be so sure that &ldquo;where sin
abounded,&rdquo; grace did not &ldquo;much more
abound?&rdquo;&nbsp; At the best, his objection rests on an
unproved assumption in principle&mdash;an assumption too,
directly at variance with our experience of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> past dealings with man; as the
history of the Jewish people bears witness.&nbsp; It would be
difficult, as we remarked in our last Lecture, to find any
parallel in the history of the Christian Church to the godless
impieties of the Jewish, during four hundred years previous to
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> coming, and yet the
anointing oil of the Priesthood was not inefficacious, nor even
the Prophetical gifts withdrawn, up to the time of the
Advent.&nbsp; Even <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
persecutor Caiaphas &ldquo;<i>prophesied</i>, being High Priest
that year.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, therefore, quite unsatisfactory,
at the least, to take for granted in this way, that general
Corruption would have totally destroyed the grace of Apostolic <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Succession.&nbsp; The utmost that can, with any show of
fairness, be pretended is, that it <i>might</i> have done so: and
even this ought surely to be proved and not barely assumed as it
here is.&nbsp; And even supposing that this were proved, then
there would be one thing more to be shown, namely, that the
amount of corruption in the Church had really, in point of fact,
reached that height, which would overwhelm the grace of Her
instituted Ministry.&nbsp; And how this could be certainly
proved, even if true, it seems hard to say.&nbsp; In the nature
of things, it would ever remain a point uncertain to man, and
known to <span class="smcap">God</span> alone.&nbsp; Our
objectors, therefore, must assume this point too.&nbsp; And
without, perhaps, being much justified in their assumption by the
facts of history.&nbsp; For while a lofty moral sense is
recognized among men, and so long as humility and self-devotion
to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and disinterested, even though
untaught, zeal, are reckoned Christian virtues,&mdash;so long, in
spite of party misrepresentations, will the great body of our
Christian forefathers, lay and clerical, in the middle ages bear
honourable comparison with us their overweening children.&nbsp;
There is more of the spirit of pride than the spirit of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;more of party vanity than of
Catholic generosity&mdash;more of historical ignorance than of
philosophical wisdom, in these self-congratulatory comparisons
between our <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>meagre conflicting, though (if you will) enlightened,
&ldquo;systems&rdquo; of Religion and the One high-minded faith,
and chivalrous piety, and unsystematized benevolence of our less
instructed ancestors.&mdash;At all events, the vague objections
drawn from these intangible charges of general corruption, very
plainly rest on two unproved assumptions&mdash;one of the
principle and one of the fact.&nbsp; And this, perhaps, is all
that is necessary to be shown.&nbsp; For is not the Succession
itself a fact of sufficient magnitude to make us pause before we
say, it is <span class="GutSmall">WORTH NOTHING</span>?&nbsp;
This undeniable fact which we allege; this Succession of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> Apostolic Ministry; this,
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> sustained marvel of
eighteen hundred years, is assailed by man&rsquo;s bare
assertion, &lsquo;that it has been <span
class="GutSmall">SUSTAINED FOR NOTHING</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But from among these general charges of Corruption, there
sometimes is one singled out, as of a magnitude too great to be
doubtful, and to the believer in Revelation too malignant to be
of questionable effect: the charge, I mean, of Idolatry.&nbsp; If
there were nothing else, it is said, to impede the spiritual
grace of the Succession, the Idolatry prevalent in the Churches
of the Roman Communion would be amply sufficient.&nbsp; And in
proof of this, the case of the Jewish Church is confidently
quoted, and the fierce denunciations uttered and <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>executed
against <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> favoured people
for this especial sin, beyond all others.&nbsp; Now here too we
seem to have some unproved assumptions; as well as some false
reasoning from the analogy of the Jewish people.&nbsp; First of
all there is the assumption which we have previously noticed,
namely, that there <i>is</i> an amount of personal human sin
which <i>fatally</i> cuts off, or obstructs, the instituted
channels of Divine grace; which has never yet been proved.&nbsp;
Then there is the assumption that idolatry is the specific sin
whose guilt would have this effect.&nbsp; And this may possibly
be true&mdash;when the first assumption is made good&mdash;but as
yet, this has not been proved.&nbsp; And then there is the third
assumption, that the Church in the middle ages was so fully and
universally guilty of this sin of idolatry, as to cut off the
virtue of the Apostolic Succession for ever.&nbsp; And I need
hardly say that this has not been proved, for it must in any case
remain a doubtful point&mdash;beyond our power to settle for
certain.&nbsp; And yet how unheedingly these three assumptions
are made use of in the arguments so resolutely and thanklessly
urged from the parallel circumstances of the Jews.&nbsp; In the
first place it is assumed that the grace of the Jewish
institutions was so cut off as to be <i>lost</i> on account of
idolatry, in the times before <span class="smcap">Christ</span>;
which cannot be shown. (Rom. xi. 29.)&nbsp; <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>For even if
it be shown that that Divine grace was quite suspended during a
season of idolatry, it would still be certain, that when the
Idolatry was repented of and forsaken, the grace reflowed through
the accustomed channels of the Mosaic Institutes.&nbsp; And in
spite of all past idolatries, it had not been wholly cut off even
at the time of the Coming of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; In the next place there is a
false assumption concerning the sin of idolatry itself; which
seems to have been so severely visited as it was, because it was
the specifically forbidden sin, the protesting against which was
one great special object of the national existence of the Jews
amidst a godless world.&nbsp; It was not, surely, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> abhorred idol worship more than murder,
or uncleanness, or injustice; but it was, that &ldquo;in Judah
was <span class="smcap">God</span> to be known&rdquo;&mdash;the
one <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;the forgotten <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;amidst Gentile polytheism, until
the Coming of The Great Mediator.&nbsp; Every Divine interference
with that nation seemed to bear this as its reason, &ldquo;That
all the earth may know that there is a <span
class="smcap">God</span> in Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, He is the <span
class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> He is the <span
class="smcap">God</span>!&rdquo; (Joshua iv. 24; 1 Kings viii.
42, 43; Psalm lx. throughout, &amp;c.)&nbsp; Idolatry in that
nation had a heinousness beyond all other sin.&nbsp; And great as
the guilt of idolatry must ever be, yet it can hardly be called
in the <i>same</i> sense, the specific design of <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the existence
of the Christian Church, to protest against that sin beyond all
others.&nbsp; And until this can be made good, the strict
parallel cannot be established.&nbsp; In the third place, there
is a further assumption of an actual analogy of sinfulness in
this particular, between the Jewish and Christian Churches, which
is not borne out by facts.&nbsp; Jewish idolatry implied a
voluntary and intentional abandonment of the worship of <span
class="smcap">Jehovah</span>.&nbsp; Now this can in no wise be
affirmed of the worst idolatry of the Romish Hierarchy.&nbsp; No
one will say that the Churches in communion with Rome, ever
intended to abandon the worship of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, for the sake of Angels and
Saints.&nbsp; It may be safely and truly said, that their
reverence paid to images, and their invocations of saints and
angels, are of an idolatrous nature, and calculated to lead, and
have led, to idolatry in the common people; but it would be
unreasonable and untrue to say, that the sin of the Church of
Rome in this matter was the <i>same</i> sin as that of the Jews
when they deliberately abandoned the worship of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And, therefore, we cannot argue
from the one to the other.</p>
<p>If we thus look into this objection fairly, we must see how
very little it amounts to.&nbsp; It depends throughout on
unproved assumptions.&nbsp; And so far <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>as we may take the analogy in the
case of the Jewish Church, it tells directly against the
objection.&nbsp; For there cannot be shown more, at most, than a
suspension of the grace of the Mosaic Institutes.&nbsp; And if
even Jewish idolatry, when repented of, was no impediment to the
reflux of the Divine blessing, so it might be in the Christian
Church, even if it could be proved universally guilty of the very
sin of the Jews&mdash;which it cannot be.&nbsp; In different
ages, and at different places, some Churches, in communion with
Rome, have paid a highly sinful honour to Saints and their
images.&nbsp; The amount of such honour has varied greatly in
degree, being more or less sinful, at different times and places;
yet at the worst, it was never universal, in any essentially
idolatrous degree.&nbsp; And even if it had been, there would
only (if the analogy were ever so strictly borne out) be a
suspension of still latent Apostolic grace, which any branches of
the Church might, on repentance, again enjoy.&nbsp; Far be it
from us indeed to palliate the sin, or the danger, of the
idolatrous practices of the present Church of Rome, but let a
legitimate and not a superficial estimate thereof be made.&nbsp;
Instead of being misled by words, let us look to
principles.&nbsp; We are bound to protest against all which draws
off the heart from the true <span class="smcap">God</span> and
only <span class="smcap">Saviour Jesus Christ</span>; and
therefore against Idolatry in <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>all its forms.&nbsp; The Churches
throughout the world, in communion with that of Rome, have
conformed to the practices of the ungodly world in one way; but
so have we in another.&nbsp; And as the heathenish conformities
and superstitions of Romanists are condemned by St. Paul, when he
forbids Christians even to &ldquo;eat of things offered to
idols;&rdquo; so the infidel coldness and individual selfishness
of many Protestants are equally condemned, when we are bidden to
flee from covetousness, &ldquo;which is idolatry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whether, with some, we make idols of a particular Church and the
Saints,&mdash;or with others, make idols of Private Judgment and
Mammon, we are alike guilty.&nbsp; Let there be no rude,
impatient haste in judging of any Christians.&nbsp; So long as
<span class="smcap">God</span> bears with us, we may well bear
with one another.&nbsp; Idolatry, worse than the Romish, was
sanctioned by some of the Churches of Asia.&nbsp; But still they
were addressed as &ldquo;Churches.&rdquo;&nbsp; That very
sanction of actual heathen idolatry, which the Churches had been
warned against, they were guilty of allowing.&nbsp; Of both
Pergamos and Thyatira it is said in sharp rebuke, that they
permitted some among them &ldquo;to eat of things offered to
idols,&rdquo; which almost amounted to an admission of those
heathen gods.&nbsp; And yet, as <span
class="smcap">Churches</span> still, they are warned to
&ldquo;repent and do the <span class="GutSmall">FIRST</span>
works,&rdquo; lest <span class="smcap">God</span> should be
provoked <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>to &ldquo;remove their candlestick out of his
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it was not removed as yet.&mdash;While the
Church Catholic endures perpetually, <span
class="smcap">God</span> cuts off from time to time its
irrecoverably corrupt branches.&nbsp; But it is for <span
class="smcap">God</span>, not us, to do it.&nbsp; And with this,
let us dismiss the Objection concerning Idolatry.</p>
<p>One further Objection which we shall notice, as connected with
the Fact of the Succession, is that which is urged, though in
very different senses, against our own Church in particular, by
Romanists on the one hand, and Sectarians on the other; both
anxious to deny us the possession of that grace of Apostolical
Ministry, which the former desire to monopolize, and the latter
to set at nought altogether.&nbsp; &lsquo;If (say they with
somewhat of <i>ambiguity</i> of expression) the Succession is in
the Church <span class="smcap">Catholic</span>, they who are in a
state of Schism, cannot be considered to possess it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now if we were to admit this position exactly as they state it,
they would then have to prove us Schismatics, with respect to the
<span class="smcap">Church Catholic</span>, before they could, on
this ground, invalidate our Succession.&nbsp; But, in truth, the
objection ought to be a little more carefully looked into.&nbsp;
The sin of Schism admits of various degrees.&nbsp; Of course, if
it be clearly made out that any part of the Church is (not partly
torn only, but) totally severed <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>from the Body Catholic, it follows,
that that part has not that Sacramental grace which the Church
alone possesses.&nbsp; But it is certain that in its fullest
sense, even Romanists, acknowledging, as they do, Lay-baptism,
could not thus cut off as <i>totally</i> Schismatic, all who are
not of their communion;&mdash;all the Churches of the East, and
of the farthest West&mdash;The American, the Scotch, and our
own.&nbsp; And the Sectarians cannot, for very shame, deny us a
place in the Universal Church.&nbsp; That very liberality which
they need for their own sakes will afford us some shelter
too.&nbsp; And as to the special charge of heinous Schism urged
against us in the particular matter of our Reformation; if we
admit it, as fully, as any party can afford to urge it, it could
not go the length of invalidating our Orders Apostolical.&nbsp;
The Church Catholic anathematized us not; but only the Bishop of
Rome, who had not any right or power so to do, <a
name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a> but was himself Schismatical and
Anti-christian in attempting it; as St. Iren&aelig;us might have
taught him.&nbsp; The Church Catholic we would have been content
to be judged by. <a name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a>&nbsp; We appealed to a General
Council, and after wearisome denial and delay, and artifice, they
offered us the mockery of Trent.&nbsp; About a hundred and fifty
years after <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>our Reformation, we were recognized as a Church by the
Greek Church: <a name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a> though the attempt to unite us with
them in one Communion unhappily failed.&nbsp; At the time of our
Reformation, notwithstanding much temptation, much carelessness,
and much sin, our Apostolical Succession seemed marvellously
guarded, as by a heavenly hand.&nbsp; The documents are as plain,
the facts as sure, as history, invidiously sifted, can make them;
so that the candid Romanist and the learned Jesuit cannot deny
them.&nbsp; Let any one examine it for himself.&nbsp; Any man,
who will deal fairly with facts, will be obliged to own that
there have been greater confusions and Schisms <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> in the see of Rome itself, than in the
see of Canterbury.&mdash;But they who go the length of affirming
a cessation of Apostolic grace in any particular Church or branch
of a Church on the ground of total Schism, from the whole body of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, must excuse us if we ask them
for proof of their assertion; and tell them, that until it is
proved, we must treat it as a pure (though a very convenient)
assumption.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Those
further historical and practical Objections which might be urged
against the Apostolical Succession, either in the Church
Universal, or in our own particular branch of it, would be such
as attempt to throw some degree of doubt on the fact itself; <a
name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a> and they have already been answered by
anticipation in the last Lecture, in which we mainly dwelt on the
<span class="smcap">Evidence</span> of the fact.&nbsp; To notice
them here in any greater detail, would therefore be only to
repeat needlessly what has been already said.&nbsp; But closely
connected with the Objections thus briefly considered to the
facts of the Succession, there are generally supposed to be
certain fatal <span class="GutSmall">CONSEQUENCES</span>, which
it may be well just to glance at.&nbsp; &ldquo;Popery,&rdquo; and
its fearful train of practical evils, an infringement of liberty
of conscience, and spiritual slavery, are apprehended as the sure
result, if the Apostolical line be admitted to be
preserved.&nbsp; But is it thus?&nbsp; Are any of us anxious for
a &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; which is confessedly synonymous with a
freedom from obedience to <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
own laws and appointments?&nbsp; Or can we not admit the right of
any man to &ldquo;liberty of conscience,&rdquo; without insisting
that such a liberty will suffice to guide him into all
truth?&nbsp; Doubtless <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>every man has a right to move on
unshackled towards the &ldquo;heavenly city,&rdquo; but shall he
therefore dispense with the only effectual guide?&nbsp; Granting
him the fullest &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; may he not yet miss his
way?&mdash;Whoever will take the pains to think of it, will see
that this Apostolical doctrine of the Succession, is no other
kind of restraint upon liberty of conscience, than any other
Apostolical doctrine.&nbsp; It may certainly be said that if a
man be not blessed with the blessings of the Church Apostolical,
he is in a perilous condition; but it is difficult to see how
this affects liberty of conscience, any more than the assertion,
&ldquo;He that believeth not shall be condemned.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
that such an Objection is only that of the infidel, in a slightly
modified shape, when he complains of the &ldquo;hardship of not
providing for the case of the conscientious
unbeliever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as to the fear of Popery; that seems a still more strange
Objection.&nbsp; Surely the very reverse is the more correct
reasoning.&nbsp; If it be a fact capable of proof, and which was
believed by all Christians for 1500 years, That there was a true
Succession of Ministers from the Apostles&mdash;are we not taking
the very surest ground against Romanists, when we show, that we
possess just such a descended <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Ministry, in no degree dependent on
communion with <i>their</i> Church, or any other single
Church?&nbsp; If we could <i>not</i> show such a Ministry, then
the man, who from examination found out the truth of the
necessity of an Apostolic Church, might be obliged indeed to
resort to the communion of Rome.&nbsp; So that by asserting our
true Apostolical claims, we are so far from giving place to Rome,
that we are striking the only effectual blow at her
supremacy&mdash;we are so far from forcing a man to join the
Papacy, that we are offering him his only refuge from its
spiritual tyranny.&nbsp; And as to all such half-infidel
objections as, &lsquo;that there would be nothing to check the
onward advance of corruption and error,&rsquo; and the like, if
it were thus taken to be unlawful to sin against, or set aside,
the Apostolical Succession, in any case; it would be quite enough
to reply, that we ought to be content to trust <span
class="smcap">God</span> for the success of His own appointed
institutions.&nbsp; But there are facts, sufficiently strong to
enable us to speak much more explicitly on this head.&nbsp; Among
those who threw off the Roman yoke in the sixteenth century, we
see, that the Non-episcopal communities of the Continent have
gone down into worse than Roman Corruption, &ldquo;even denying
<span class="GutSmall">THE</span> <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
that bought them;&rdquo; from which depth of doctrinal corruption
our Episcopal Church has been graciously preserved.&nbsp; <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Not, indeed,
that it is right to depend too much on this kind of evidence,
popular as it may be.&nbsp; It is better for the Christian to
exercise a habit of unenquiring confidence in his Heavenly
Father, trusting Him for the &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; of His
Own appointments, disregarding the sophistries, and fears, and
oppositions of the world.</p>
<p>Passing, now, from this class of Practical Objections, let us
consider some of those which are supposed to lie against the
<span class="smcap">Doctrine</span> of the Succession.&nbsp; They
are, indeed, so peculiarly unchristian, so faithless in their
principles, and so indefinite in their shape, that it will not be
so easy a task to deal with them; but we must briefly attempt
it.</p>
<p>One of the commonest and most comprehensive of these
objections, is that which is advanced against the whole Doctrine
of an Authoritative Ministry in the Church, though more
especially against the notion of a Descended Priesthood;
viz.&nbsp; That it is a going back to &ldquo;beggarly
elements,&rdquo; a perpetuation of Judaism in the Church.&nbsp;
They who urge this, do not scruple to deny all similarity of
office between the Christian and the Jewish Priesthood, and they
represent it as essentially Anti-christian in any man in these
days <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>to
pretend to the Priestly office.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; say they,
&ldquo;it be even granted that a separate order of Ministers is
sanctioned by the Gospel, still it is both arrogant and
unscriptural to pretend to institute any sort of parallel between
the Christian and the Jewish Ministries.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
strange that any man can speak so thoughtlessly, who has had the
advantage of reading even an English Testament.&nbsp; Not only is
the principle of the necessity of a proper Ministry assumed
throughout the Christian Scriptures, but the very analogy which
is now denied between the Christian and the Jewish ministries is
<i>throughout</i> assumed, and sometimes expressly insisted on,
and drawn out.&nbsp; If it were so dangerous and Anti-christian
an error to pretend to a Priesthood in the Church, at all
resembling that of the Temple, surely the Apostles would have
been especially anxious to avoid using any expressions which
should seem to imply any such thing.&nbsp; St. Paul&rsquo;s
language, if not to be taken simply as he employed it&mdash;that
is, if it were not literally <i>true</i>&mdash;was calculated
much to mislead.&nbsp; It could not have been safe, when the
early Church had so strong a tendency to Judaize, to make use of
what may be called &ldquo;priestly terms&rdquo; and
allusions.&nbsp; And yet this is done continually in the New
Testament, and even as a &ldquo;matter of course.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Observe, for instance, that sentence of St. Paul, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>specially
concerning the ancient Priesthood, but so widely expressed as to
convey a general principle, assumed as known to be equally true
now as of old&mdash;&ldquo;No man taketh this honour to himself,
but he that is called of <span class="smcap">God</span> as was
Aaron.&rdquo; (Heb. v. 1, 4).&nbsp; So the Holy Baptist at the
beginning of the Gospel puts forth this as an Evangelical
principle, concerning any Divine Ministry, not excepting
Christ&rsquo;s Own; &ldquo;A man can <i>take unto himself</i>
nothing&rdquo; [margin]. (John iii. 27, &amp;c.)&nbsp; St. Paul
likewise calls <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself
&ldquo;the Apostle and High-priest,&rdquo; linking the two ideas
together&mdash;joining the Apostolical and the Priestly
offices&mdash;but saying that even <span class="smcap">He</span>
&ldquo;glorified not Himself to be made an High-priest.&rdquo; <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a>&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Father</span> &ldquo;sent&rdquo; Him; and &ldquo;as
His <span class="smcap">Father</span> sent <span
class="smcap">Him</span>, so He sent His Apostles.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And what, again, might we not fairly conclude from such an
allusion as the following, even if there were nothing more
clear?&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">We</span> have an
<i>altar</i> whereof they have no right to eat which serve the
tabernacle;&rdquo; (Heb. xiii. 10.) which occurs immediately
after the injunction concerning the Ministry, &ldquo;remember
<span class="GutSmall">THEM</span>&rdquo; (v. 7).&nbsp; And in
the verses immediately following, we find a similar injunction,
and similar sacrificial allusions; (v. 11, 15&ndash;17.)&nbsp;
Must we not think that the <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Apostle recognized <i>some</i>
analogy between the Jewish and the Christian Ministries? <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; But we have, in addition to such
manifold allusions, some passages much more direct and
indisputable.&nbsp; In writing to the Corinthians, St. Paul
places the Eucharistic Table of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> in a position precisely parallel with
that of the Jewish Altar, and founds his whole argument on it; (1
Cor. x. 13, &amp;c.) and places together on the same footing the
Ministries of the Temple and of the Church, (ch. ix. 13.)&nbsp;
His argument for the right of the Christian Minister to a
temporal maintenance is wholly derived from the analogy of the
Jewish Priesthood; this would, then, be no argument, if there
were no analogy.&nbsp; His words are, &ldquo;Do ye not know that
they which Minister about holy things, live of the things of the
altar? <i>even so hath</i> <span class="smcap">the Lord</span>
<i>ordained</i>, that they that preach the Gospel should live of
the Gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evidently the former Ministry is assumed
to be the pattern of the <i>latter</i>.&nbsp; But in another
place, it is still more fully carried out.&nbsp; The Apostle
shows the Corinthians, that the analogy between the two
Ministries was such as to raise the Christian Ministry
immeasurably superior to the Jewish, both in privilege and
power.&nbsp; What Jewish Priest could ever use <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>such exalted
language as St. Paul had employed concerning the punishment of
sin? (1 Cor. v. 5.) or its pardon? (2 Cor. ii. 10, 11, 15.)&nbsp;
And so he declared his Ministry to be much superior to that of
Moses himself. (2 Cor. iii. 7.)&nbsp; &ldquo;If the Ministration
of condemnation (the Jewish Ministry) be glory, how much more
doth the Ministration of righteousness (the Christian)
<i>exceed</i> in glory?&nbsp; For even that which was made
glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of that <i>which
excelleth</i>; for if that which was done away was glorious,
<i>much more</i> that which remaineth is glorious.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Moses, he further shows, had a &ldquo;veiled,&rdquo; we an
&ldquo;unveiled&rdquo; Ministry.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">We</span> all with unveiled face, beholding as in a
glass, the glory of the Lord.&rdquo; (v. 18.)&nbsp; &ldquo;We
preach not <i>ourselves</i>,&rdquo; indeed, he adds, &ldquo;but
<span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span> the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, <span class="GutSmall">AND</span>
Ourselves your servants for <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>&rsquo; sake; <i>for</i> <span
class="smcap">God</span> . . . hath shined in <span
class="smcap">Our</span> hearts, to give the light of the
knowledge of His glory.&rdquo; (ch. iv. 6; see also ch. v. 19,
20.)&mdash;The promises of abiding grace, &ldquo;enduring&rdquo;
mercy, and perpetual blessing to the ancient Israel, are commonly
enough thought to await fulfilment in the Church: so also, shall
not the ancient promises of an everlasting Priesthood, which were
not fulfilled to the Jews, be amply fulfilled in the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>?&mdash;The <span
class="smcap">One</span> Priesthood of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> &ldquo;continueth ever&rdquo;
manifested in <span class="smcap">His</span> <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Church
according to <span class="smcap">His</span> will; &ldquo;not
after the law of a carnal commandment, <i>but</i>
(<i>&alpha;&pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</i>)
<i>after the power of an endless life</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be thought needless to dwell longer on this
objection to the doctrine of the proper Ministry of the
Church.&nbsp; The other objections, however, which are commonly
urged, are of so similar a character as to be partly answered
already, by what has been said.&nbsp; It may be useful,
nevertheless, to bestow a few more remarks on them.&nbsp; Some
who scarcely like to object to the Doctrine of the Ministry in
open terms, are given to speak of the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Succession</span>&rdquo; as a &ldquo;carnal&rdquo;
doctrine, though without clearly showing us any other doctrine to
supply its place.&nbsp; It would be well for those who lightly
adopt such language, if they would weigh its <i>meaning</i>,
before they make such use of it.&nbsp; If by calling the
Succession a &ldquo;carnal&rdquo; doctrine, they mean that the
doctrine is very different from, and perhaps inconsistent with
all that <i>they</i> take to be &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; there is
nothing very fearful in the charge.&nbsp; Only it is scarcely
consistent with Christian humility to adopt from Scripture a term
of opprobrium, in order to make of it a private use of our
own.&nbsp; Such objectors may be reminded that there were some in
the Church of Corinth, who took themselves to be
&ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; enough to dispute the <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span><span
class="smcap">Apostle&rsquo;s</span> directions in some Church
matters.&nbsp; And St. Paul replied simply by asserting his
Ministerial authority, however &ldquo;carnal&rdquo; that might be
thought.&nbsp; His words are, &ldquo;If any think himself to be a
prophet, or <i>spiritual</i>, let him acknowledge that the things
that I write are the commandments of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo; (1 Cor. xiv. 37.)&nbsp; At all
events the charge of &ldquo;carnality&rdquo; ought to be a little
explained, that we may know what meaning to affix to it.&nbsp; In
what sense, for instance, the &ldquo;Doctrine of laying on of
hands,&rdquo; can be called carnal, and not also the doctrine of
&ldquo;Baptism by water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there are those who somewhat modify this objection, and
say, that our doctrine is too &ldquo;technical&rdquo; to be
worthy of a Divine Revelation.&nbsp; That is to say, it is
unworthy of the spirituality and dignity of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> religion to be thus
necessarily allied to outward and sensible forms.&nbsp; But
surely this is as pure an <i>assumption</i>, as all the
<i>other</i> objections which have been considered.&nbsp; At
least, it remains to be <i>proved</i>; and so far as the analogy
of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> previous dealing with
mankind may guide us, we should be inclined perhaps to a very
different conclusion.&nbsp; What, for instance, could be more
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; than the Scriptural account of the sin of
Adam?&nbsp; The moral aspect of the offence is <i>not</i> dwelt
on; it is simply <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>presented to us as a disobedience of a set injunction, a
failure in formal allegiance.&mdash;What, again, could be more
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; than the acceptable sacrifice of
Abel?&mdash;Or the trial of Abraham&rsquo;s faith?&mdash;And
might we not point in a similar way to the whole system
established by <span class="smcap">God</span> among the
Jews?&mdash;Or let the more Spiritual institute of
&ldquo;Prophecy&rdquo; be considered.&nbsp; There was much in it
that would now be thought very &ldquo;technical.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
prophet Balaam, <a name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a> though an unholy man, had power to
&ldquo;bless and curse;&rdquo; there was a potency in his
word.&nbsp; And then we read of the &ldquo;<i>schools</i> of the
prophets.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Spirit of Prophecy seemed poured
out in so technical and systematic a way, that there were certain
places, and hours, and modes, <a name="citation93b"></a><a
href="#footnote93b" class="citation">[93b]</a> in which the
Spirit was in active energy, in such wise that strangers who came
near were affected by it.&nbsp; So we read, that king Saul and
his messengers, when they came to the company of prophets at
Ramah, all began likewise to prophesy; (1 Sam. xix. 23.) just as
Saul himself had done on another occasion, previous to his
anointing (ch. x. 10).&nbsp; Or, to come to a later period, how
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; does the Ministry of the Baptist appear
throughout!&nbsp; And yet our Lord submitted to his
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; Baptism, saying, <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;<i>Thus</i> it becometh us to fulfil all
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And surely we might make the same
kind of remarks on the whole life of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> Himself.&nbsp; Look at the formal
Genealogies at the beginning.&mdash;Is it not a strangely
&ldquo;technical&rdquo; appointment, that a grace so divine as
that which redeemed mankind must needs flow through the line of
David?&nbsp; And be recorded so scrupulously, as though each link
of the chain were important?&mdash;And in all that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> did, is there not much that might by
some be called &ldquo;technicality?&rdquo;&nbsp; His conformity
to the Jewish ritual: His temptation, His replies to the Jews,
His difficulties, questions, and dark sayings, and many of His
miracles, might surely by many be so esteemed. <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a>&nbsp; And then again, His Church and
Sacraments: and His injunctions to the Apostles; as that, to
&ldquo;begin at Jerusalem&rdquo; in their preaching, which they
technically obeyed to the letter. (Acts xiii. 46.)&nbsp; But
enough is plain, surely, from all this to show us that the
technical nature of an institution <i>may</i> be no objection
whatever to the Divine sanction of it.&nbsp; At all events, the
contrary is an assumption requiring proof.&nbsp; Nay, further; if
it be true, that man&rsquo;s sight cannot at present endure the
light of unveiled truth, then it may be that some sort of
technical expression <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>of truth might even be expected in a
Divine revelation.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> manifests
Himself &ldquo;in part,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in part&rdquo; He
shrouds Himself from us still.</p>
<p>But after all that has been said, there will be some who will
rejoin: If this doctrine were of so great an importance, why is
there not some much plainer statement about it in
Scripture&mdash;something, that is, which might put it beyond
doubt?&nbsp; It might be worth considering in reply to this,
whether such a question does not arise from a complete
misapprehension of the nature and design of the Inspired
Volume?&nbsp; But, in any case, it is evident that the Socinian,
or even the Infidel might easily ask the very same thing.&nbsp;
The Scripture testimony to the doctrine of the <span
class="smcap">Trinity</span>, plain as we think it, is evidently
not <i>so</i> plain as to prevent doubts and differences of
opinion.&nbsp; Can that be a valid objection against the doctrine
of the Succession, which is none whatever against the <span
class="smcap">Trinity</span>?&nbsp; The Arians of the fourth age
would gladly have accepted of any thing in
&ldquo;Scripture-terms,&rdquo; and pleaded hard for leaving the
truth of the <span class="smcap">Trinity</span> in a (so called)
&ldquo;Scriptural&rdquo; vagueness of expression.&nbsp; But the
Catholic Church determined otherwise.&nbsp; And Her
interpretation of those Scriptures which contain the Apostolical
Succession, is quite as uniform and unequivocal as <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>of those
which contain the truth of the <span class="smcap">Holy
Trinity</span>.</p>
<p>Here, while leaving this class of objections also, (raised,
like the former, on pure assumptions) we must not omit to remind
any who are trying by the aid of such objections to rid
themselves of the Catholic truth, that there is, at best, a
fearful uncertainty in the course which they are so
pursuing&mdash;an uncertainty which seems not to have one solid
advantage of any kind to recommend it.&mdash;But now before
terminating our remarks on the manifold objections of men to this
truth of <span class="smcap">God</span>, it is important perhaps
to make reference to some of the supposed, and the real
Consequences of admitting this Apostolical Doctrine.&nbsp; In
speaking of these, perhaps, our opponents manifest less knowledge
and more unfairness, than with respect to any other of the topics
in debate.&nbsp; The utmost pains are often taken to make out, on
the ground of our &ldquo;exclusiveness,&rdquo; a case of bigotry,
superstition, and intolerance.&nbsp; So that there is the more
occasion to direct attention to these, which, imaginary as they
are, form, nevertheless, the most cogent objections in the
popular mind.</p>
<p>In the first place, whoever puts forth any statement
concerning any subject, as the <i>truth</i>, necessarily <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>implies that
a different statement would be false; and therefore liable to all
the consequences of the falsehood.&nbsp; Whatever is put forth as
<span class="smcap">Truth</span>, is necessarily
<i>exclusive</i>.&nbsp; And is the Catholic doctrine more
chargeable with &ldquo;exclusiveness,&rdquo; on this ground, than
the doctrine of any party, or even individual?&mdash;When any man
says that he thinks himself <i>right</i> in any matter, he
virtually says that those who differ from him are
<i>wrong</i>.&nbsp; And as to the future consequences of being
wrong; it will scarcely be denied, that the Sectarians are
generally far more reckless in pronouncing judgments on that
matter than <i>we</i>.</p>
<p>The popular shape in which this objection is most successfully
brought forward is, That the doctrine of the Succession
&ldquo;unchurches&rdquo; all the Protestant communities of
Christendom, which are not Episcopal.&nbsp; This is exaggerated
and represented as the very acme of intolerance, and equivalent
to a judgment on our part that they must all necessarily perish
everlastingly.&nbsp; It is melancholy to see the art with which
this misrepresentation is brought forward to check any
half-formed conviction of the truth, such as arises from a candid
review of the unanswerable Evidence.&nbsp; It only shows us that
there are some minds which it is hopeless to attempt to
convince.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Let us,
however, look at the objection rapidly, first, in an historical,
and then in a theoretical light.&nbsp; Doubtless, if the
Apostolic Succession be admitted, it follows that there can be no
certainty of valid Sacraments apart from it.&nbsp; And those
communities cannot be pronounced to be true Churches, which have
no Succession.&nbsp; Now, upon this it is argued, that there is
an inconsistency between us and our early Reformers: for, that
<i>they</i> did not pronounce the Continental Protestants to be
&ldquo;unchurched,&rdquo; which our principles oblige us to do;
and that therefore we are more &ldquo;Popish&rdquo; and bigoted
than they.&mdash;How far this is the real state of the case, they
best can judge who are best acquainted with the writings of our
Reformers.&nbsp; As to <i>their</i> principles, they are
certainly not so doubtful as to be only arrived at by a silent
deduction from their actions.&nbsp; Take, for instance,
Archbishop Cranmer.&nbsp; His opinions, even in his later years,
after he had well looked into the matter, and had passed through
some change of sentiments, are left on record in his Sermons. <a
name="citation98"></a><a href="#footnote98"
class="citation">[98]</a>&nbsp; In speaking of the necessary and
exclusive Succession of the Ministry, he goes to the utmost
extent of the Catholic Doctrine.&nbsp; But it may be said,
generally, that the necessity of Apostolic Ordination <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>was not a
debated point at the Reformation.&nbsp; And those, abroad, who
eventually departed from the Succession, did it with so much
reluctance, and with such ample admission of their regret, <a
name="citation99a"></a><a href="#footnote99a"
class="citation">[99a]</a> that it could only be regarded as a
temporary affliction of the Church.&nbsp; When Rome was exerting
all her strength against the Reformed, it surely would have been
deemed an uncalled for severity, had the English Church been
forward to condemn the Continental brethren; especially as they
did not defend the <i>principle</i> of separation from the
Episcopacy; but just the reverse.&nbsp; It was surely enough that
our Reformers asserted their own principles, (as they plainly did
<a name="citation99b"></a><a href="#footnote99b"
class="citation">[99b]</a>) without proceeding formally to
condemn their &ldquo;less happy&rdquo; <a
name="citation99c"></a><a href="#footnote99c"
class="citation">[99c]</a> brethren abroad.&nbsp; Add to all
which, the fact, that that generation of Protestants had, all of
them, been baptized in the Catholic Church; and most of their
Ministers <i>had</i> received Episcopal Ordination; so that even
the next generation might receive valid Baptism.&nbsp; It would
be natural of course to pronounce a very careful judgment, if
any, concerning such persons.&nbsp; It might have been difficult
to say that such communities, however imperfect, were <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>&ldquo;not
Churches.&rdquo;&nbsp; This might have fully accounted for the
reserve of our Reformers, even had it been greater than it was;
more especially as the restoration of the lost Succession might
not only have been hoped for, but, at one time, even expected. <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a>&nbsp; But every one must surely
perceive the difference of <i>our</i> position from that of our
Reformers.&nbsp; We assert precisely the same principles, and in
their <i>own</i> language.&nbsp; But <i>we</i> have to act
towards men who on principle <i>reject</i> the Succession; who
are not <i>for certain</i> possessed of any Catholically Ordained
Teachers, or so surely Baptized people: and who are perpetuating
this awfully <i>doubtful</i> and Schismatical state of
things.&nbsp; If in our circumstances we were to imitate what is
thought the reserve of our Reformers, we might be fairly
suspected as not holding their <i>principles</i>.</p>
<p>But the theoretical view of this objection is, perhaps, still
more important to be considered.&nbsp; Let any man examine, what
this charge of our unchurching so many other Protestants really
amounts to, at the utmost.&nbsp; To what extent of
&ldquo;uncharitableness&rdquo; does our theory oblige
us?&mdash;And, first of all, how can we obviate the practical
difficulty already alluded to, which is urged with <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>so much
confidence, that unordained ministers of many sects, have so
large a measure of spiritual success?&mdash;It is remarkable that
they who urge this, do not see how <i>variously</i> it is often
applied to support the most opposite and jarring
sentiments.&nbsp; And who can ever decide on the real value of
any such appeals?&nbsp; We might admit, safely, that good has, at
times, been done by unordained teachers, and yet, in that, admit
nothing inconsistent with the exclusive Catholic claims of the
Ordained Ministry.&nbsp; It has often been argued that even the
Heathen Philosophy and the Mahometan Theism, were over-ruled as
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> instruments of good,
though evil in their nature: and the corruptest kind of
Christianity may be well admitted to be much better than either
of them. <a name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; We cannot indeed allow the
distorted estimate, which human vanity makes of its own good
doings; but we will not question <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> sovereignty over man&rsquo;s
sin, from which He often brings good.&nbsp; We think it wrong not
to &ldquo;receive <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&rdquo; (Luke
ix. 53.); and &ldquo;follow the Apostles;&rdquo; but we would not
<a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;call down fire from heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
think that it &ldquo;shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day
of judgment&rdquo; than for a wilful rejecter, or non-receiver of
the Apostles; but <i>we</i> judge not.&nbsp; They are in <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> hands. (Matt. x. 14.)&mdash;We
have before said that we pronounce no private judgment on
others.</p>
<p>And let it not be supposed that this is only a tacit way of
avoiding a difficulty, to which our principles fairly conduct
us.&nbsp; If they be honestly looked at, the Catholic principles
have in them far more of real charity than any others.&nbsp;
There is a large sense, in which every Baptized man is included
in the Catholic Church, and may be, according to his measure,
partaker of Her privileges; though he may not trace the grace to
its true source, but may mistake the hand that blesses him. <a
name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a>&nbsp; And the wideness of the
Catholic principle, as to the bestowal of Baptismal grace, ought
not to be lost sight of here.&nbsp; In the Church there seems to
have been recognized a sort of threefold validity of
Baptism.&nbsp; The first, <a name="citation102b"></a><a
href="#footnote102b" class="citation">[102b]</a> as ordinarily
received <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>from a Minister of the Church; the second <a
name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a> pertaining to the grace of martyrdom,
or &ldquo;Baptism by blood;&rdquo; and the third <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a> even extending in cases of extreme
necessity to Christian Confession, and the <i>earnest desire</i>
of the Sacrament.&nbsp; Doubtless, it is The All-seeing <span
class="smcap">God</span> alone who can decide on any individual
case.&nbsp; Yet it is easy to see how the Catholic doctrine does
at least open a wide door of charitable <i>hope</i>. <a
name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a>&nbsp; How many even of those who are
outwardly Schismatical, may not be <i>wholly</i> so, we can never
know here.&nbsp; How far the sincerity of some, or the
circumstances of others, may avail as excuses before <span
class="smcap">God</span>, <span class="smcap">He</span> only can
decide.&nbsp; Still, while our charity &ldquo;hopeth all
things,&rdquo; we know that where there is <i>doubt</i> only,
there may be danger; and charity itself would oblige us to warn;
for we think there <i>is</i> this peril; and we warn those
Churchmen of their greater peril, who sanction Religious
principles, or frequent even doubtful assemblies, which the
Church acknowledges not.&nbsp; They not only endanger themselves,
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>but by
their example may fatally mislead the souls of their
brethren.&nbsp; But let us take the extremest case that can be
alleged, namely, that of persons wilfully guilty of total and
deliberate Schism from the Apostolic Church.&nbsp; When we deny
to such all share in the Church&rsquo;s peculiar grace here, or
glory hereafter, are we denying them aught which they do not deny
themselves? aught which they even wish to claim?&nbsp; For
instance&mdash;The Church has ever maintained that Baptism in the
Apostolic community conveys the most exalted and unearthly
blessings, and by consequence maintains, that the unbaptized
possess them not.&nbsp; But is it not a fact, that all such
persons totally reject the notion of there being any spiritual
value in Baptism?&nbsp; Does our uncharitableness then place them
in a worse position than that which they voluntarily choose for
themselves, and resolutely defend?&nbsp; Surely we are rather
taking a high view of our own privileges and grace in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, than in any degree depriving others
of theirs.&nbsp; We leave them where they place themselves.&nbsp;
And it seems hard to call this a want of charity.&nbsp; It is
impossible to say that we are depriving of Sacraments those who
do not even pretend to them, except in form.&nbsp; It is strange
and uncandid to say, that we <span
class="GutSmall">UN</span>-church those, who (in our sense of the
word) do not even pretend to be Churches.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>This
charge of want of charity generally proceeds, too, from those who
ought certainly to be the very last to bring it forward.&nbsp;
They are our commonest assailants who themselves so gloomily
narrow the circle of possible salvation, as to affirm that all
shall inevitably perish, except that exceedingly small number
whom they esteem in their peculiar sense,
&ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; and &ldquo;converted.&rdquo;&nbsp; We,
on the contrary, whatever we think of the Church&rsquo;s
Privileges, hold with St. Peter, that &ldquo;in every nation he
that feareth <span class="smcap">God</span>, and worketh
righteousness, is accepted of <span
class="smcap">Him</span>;&rdquo; <a name="citation105a"></a><a
href="#footnote105a" class="citation">[105a]</a> and yet we are
thought &ldquo;uncharitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Far from condemning on
so tremendous a scale as they will venture to do, we pronounce no
judgment personally on any:&mdash;and yet they call us
&ldquo;uncharitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless we see unspeakable
danger in the very idea of differing or dissenting and departing
from the <span class="smcap">Church</span> <a
name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a> as descended from the Apostles of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>; but methinks there is no
bigotry in saying that.&mdash;&ldquo;Now may the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of patience and consolation grant you to
be like-minded one toward another, according to <span
class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>And
now, at the close of this review of the objections urged by vain
man against the firm, abiding truth of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, it seems impossible wholly to repress
the feeling which rises, on looking back on such melancholy
indications of mental perversity.&mdash;The view of a series of
such objections to such a Truth, accompanied as they are by a
guilty host of unnamed minor objections, taking shelter beneath
them, is almost enough to dishearten the Minister of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; It seems as if there were
arranged side by side all the elaborate tokens of a
Father&rsquo;s most tender care for a reckless family; and of
their thankless contempt for his love and watchfulness.&nbsp; The
very design of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
Ascension was to give &ldquo;Apostles and prophets&rdquo; to his
people; <a name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a> but now there are objections to them
all.&mdash;It were surely a revolting task to take by the hand
the young but corrupted heir of some princely domain, and lead
him through the stately halls of his fathers, and find him
heartlessly sneering at their massy and unbroken grandeur, and
treating with a rude contempt the mighty things and the noble of
past times&mdash;&ldquo;Objecting&rdquo; to every thing!&nbsp;
Mocking the now useless towers and unneeded
battlements&mdash;Objecting to them as &lsquo;contrivances of
cowardice.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or pointing to the <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>chapel, to
the Cross, or to some ancestral effigy of
Prayer&mdash;&ldquo;Objecting&rdquo; to them as symbols of
decaying superstition!&nbsp; It would be miserable to witness
such a wretched lack of natural piety in the heart of a
child.&mdash;But is there not some parallel to it in what is seen
among us, whensoever we &ldquo;go about our Spiritual Zion,
telling the towers thereof; marking well Her bulwarks, and
considering Her palaces, to tell it to the generation
following?&rdquo;&nbsp; We are scarcely listened to with patience
by many: and some even scorn to accompany us through our
time-honoured courts.&nbsp; Too many modern Christians,
thankless, cold-hearted children of our Holy Church, come very
little short of realizing the picture we have drawn!&nbsp; They
carelessly tread our solemn aisles, and we bid them move
reverently &ldquo;because of the angels.&rdquo; <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; And they wonder at our
&ldquo;superstition&rdquo; and &ldquo;weakness!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
&ldquo;the fathers&rdquo; (say they) were ignorant men, and their
works the cumbrous records of departed folly!&nbsp; And as to the
Saints of early days&mdash;there are decided objections to their
views; objections to their rules of sanctity; objections to their
prayers and customs, and heaven-ward observances; objections, in
a word, to almost everything <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>received from the Holy Founders of
our Faith, and loved by all our Fathers!</p>
<p>The long line of the &ldquo;departed just,&rdquo; like a
still-continued choir of angels of Bethlehem, seem to be ever
silently heralding &ldquo;peace on earth, good will to
men,&rdquo; while men weary not of raising objections thereto; as
if deeming it a hardship to be blessed!&mdash;Such is the
Church&rsquo;s mysterious history.&nbsp; An <span
class="smcap">Almighty God</span> ever &ldquo;waiting to be
gracious:&rdquo; and man rebelling against <span
class="smcap">Him</span> ever!&mdash;<span
class="smcap">God</span> sending down His gifts of grace: Man
spurning the blessing!&mdash;<span class="smcap">God</span>
&ldquo;bowing His heavens and coming down.&rdquo;&nbsp; And man
&ldquo;objecting&rdquo; still!&mdash;&ldquo;How long shall it be,

class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Eph</span>. ii. 2.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> broad and essential distinction
between the Catholic and the Rationalist views of the Christian
Ministry, seems necessarily to imply distinct conceptions of the
whole Christian Religion.&nbsp; This was briefly alluded to in
our first Lecture, but must now be more fully drawn out (though,
I fear, at the risk of some repetition) in order to show the
bearing of the respective doctrines of the Ministry on the
general Religious theory, and on the two classes of
interpretation of Holy Scripture.&nbsp; This is the more
necessary, because no arguments, however clear, will effectually
touch the mind so long as a fundamentally incorrect notion of
their whole <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>subject matter is inwardly cherished.&nbsp; So long as
one theory is exclusively and implicitly relied on, the arguments
which are built on another, essentially distinct, may be looked
at as difficult, and perhaps unanswerable; still they will not
shake the previous faith of the listener.&nbsp; The arguer is
moving, so to speak, in a parallel, or even a diverging line, in
which his hearer sees, perhaps, no exact flaw, but he is sensible
that it touches him not.&nbsp; Thus many will attend to a train
of reasoning, see that it establishes its conclusions inevitably,
and yet not be morally affected by it&mdash;not convinced, not
really touched.&nbsp; Their minds fall back on some distinct and
cherished principle which they have previously been accustomed to
admit, perhaps, without questioning; having been ever taught it,
and so relying on it as a sort of &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;
truth.&nbsp; This has been peculiarly the case in Religious
controversy.&mdash;A certain view of the general system is
received, and unless you can bring a man to think that this may
be erroneous,&mdash;that is, unless you can shake a man&rsquo;s
faith in himself, and persuade him to call in question or examine
even his fundamental notions&mdash;you have advanced but little
towards convincing him of the truth; notwithstanding the logical
accuracy of your reasonings.&nbsp; It is also to be feared that a
mistake as to the very ideality of the Christian Religion is not
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>only
very possible, but very common. <a name="citation111"></a><a
href="#footnote111" class="citation">[111]</a> It is not,
therefore, with any desire of mere systematizing that these two
distinct theories of Christianity are now drawn out; but with a
firm persuasion that there is a reality and a practical
importance in the distinction.</p>
<p>Doubtless there are many modifications of opinion among
Christians; but there are two bases on which they are very
generally raised, and perhaps almost necessarily so; a basis of
mental Principles, or a basis of Divine Institutions; a basis of
intelligible &ldquo;Doctrines,&rdquo; or of Heavenly Realities;
of that which is abstract, or that which is concrete.&nbsp; And
the former of these may be (and I trust, without offence)
described as the Rationalized, or Sectarian,&mdash;the latter is
the Catholic basis.&nbsp; The former, at first sight, seems more
philosophical and elevated and popular&mdash;the latter, more
positive, more real, and yet more humbling to the pride of human
intellect.</p>
<p>It is with the latter, indeed, that we shall be especially
concerned in this Lecture; but we must so far dwell on the
former, as may be necessary <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>for the sake of illustration and
contrast.&nbsp; Instead however of formally arguing against the
former theory, and attempting to disprove its basis, (which would
draw us too far from our object,) let us rather endeavour to
develope the true Catholic conception of Christianity, and show
its exact coincidence with the literal Scriptures of Truth.&nbsp;
An erring Christian man may by observing this be more likely to
suspect, at least, the soundness of the opposite
conception.&nbsp; There is a power in truth; and it is often as
useful to state it clearly as to argue for it.&nbsp; Many men do
not see even the apparent ground on which Church principles
rest&mdash;they do not enter into our theory, so as to understand
what they themselves dissent from.&nbsp; And on the other hand,
many right-minded believers, from want of sufficient clearness of
views, adopt a mode of defence which sanctions, or implies,
Sectarian <i>principle</i>.&nbsp; How many Dissenters, for
example, oppose us, on the ground of our union with the State; or
of our having a written Liturgy; or written Sermons; or certain
forms and ceremonies; forgetting that these are not specific
<i>Church</i>-questions; that these might have been otherwise
decided among us than they are, i.e. that we might not have been
allied to the State, nor have been accustomed to a written
Liturgy, nor written Sermons, and yet that our Churchmanship
might <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>have been, in every principle, the same
precisely.&mdash;And again, how many Churchmen defend our general
system just as if the Clergy were the essential, that is,
constituent body of the Church; or defend our Episcopacy with
confidence from insufficient texts; or defend our Apostolicity on
the ground of a Threefold order of Ministration being traceable
even to Apostolic times: little thinking how far such kinds of
defence are inaccurate, and even involve Sectarian principle.</p>
<p>But to resume;&mdash;the popular idea <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a> seems to be, that Christianity is a
complete Revelation of certain truths concerning <span
class="smcap">God</span> and a future state; and the end to be
aimed at, therefore, is the impressing men strongly with those
truths, &ldquo;applying them&rdquo; (as the phrase is) &ldquo;to
individuals.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Catholic conception is, that
Christianity is a sustained Revelation, or Manifestation of
realities; and the great end to be attained is the participation
therein.&mdash;Thus the Sectarian (according as his sentiments
might be) would dwell much on the idea of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> moral teaching, as being
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; and &ldquo;useful;&rdquo; or again, would look
on His Mediation and Atonement, just as &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; to
be believed.&nbsp; The Catholic would endeavour to regard <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> in <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>a less abstract, a more literally
Scriptural way, as The Mysterious Incarnation of Godhead (1 Tim.
iii. 16); the now and Ever-existing link between us and <span
class="smcap">Deity</span> (1 Tim. ii. 5.)&mdash;the medium
whereby man is united unto <span class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp;
And His mysterious Atonement would be regarded as an awful <span
class="GutSmall">REALITY</span> ever &ldquo;manifest&rdquo; in
the Church! (Gal. iii. 1; 1 Cor. xi. 26.)&mdash;a <span
class="GutSmall">REALITY</span> to be partaken of, and more than
a bare &lsquo;truth&rsquo; to be believed in. (1 Cor. x. 16,
17.)&nbsp; The former would go no further than to think that the
end to be attained is, the formation of a certain character in
individuals, by certain moral means; and so the whole of the
constitutions of Christianity&mdash;Scriptures, Sacraments,
Ministries, and Churches, are but the means of accomplishing this
end.&nbsp; The latter believes much more; namely, that the great
end to be attained is the mystical incorporation of an unseen,
yet eternal community, called even now, the &ldquo;kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the one system, we are independent
beings: on the other, we are &ldquo;blessed with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly places in Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the one
system, it is metaphorically only that we are said to be
&ldquo;one body in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo;
while we really are, and shall only be dealt with, as separate
individuals: on the other, the very reverse is assumed; namely,
that &ldquo;we, being many, are one body in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo; in a mystical and Divine <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>sense.&nbsp; The question is&mdash;which view is more
conformable to Holy Scripture?</p>
<p>Now, supposing the Sectarian idea to be fully adequate and
right, is there not something very unaccountable, to say the
least, even in the structure of the Christian system?&nbsp;
Supposing (that is) that we were so discerning, and could see so
far into <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> designs, as to be
able, for instance, to say, that the &ldquo;conversion,&rdquo;
(as it is called) or the moral change of an individual as such,
were the sole end, to be produced by certain doctrines inwardly
received; and that this is the whole of Christianity:&mdash;Is
not the institution of what must then seem so strange a rite as
&lsquo;Baptism with water,&rsquo; quite unaccountable?&mdash;Of
course it will be easy to say, that such a rite may be taken as a
&ldquo;type and sign&rdquo; of spiritual truth; but is this
cumbrous explanation satisfactory?&nbsp; Are not mere types and
signs out of place, &ldquo;out of keeping,&rdquo; so to speak, in
a system so purely abstract?&mdash;At all events, must not all
allow, that the existence of such an institution as Baptism (to
name no other) is much more in accordance with the <span
class="smcap">Church</span> doctrine of mystical incorporation,
than with any other?&mdash;Much more suitable to a system which
insists on a hidden virtue infallibly conveyed by the ordinance
of the <span class="smcap">Son</span> of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, than <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>to a system which reckons it
&ldquo;not essential,&rdquo; even if right at all?&nbsp; A
thoughtful man can hardly fail to perceive, that any such
institutes as those which are and ever have been common in all
the Churches, are incumbrances to what is now thought the
&ldquo;simplicity of the Gospel,&rdquo;&mdash;are at variance
altogether with the modern spirit and principle.&nbsp; If the
bringing of certain doctrines to the consciences of individuals
were the sole or specific design, what a strangely inapplicable
and unwieldy array of means must the whole Church system
be!&nbsp; And yet, a Church, and certain institutions therein,
are recognised in Scripture.&nbsp; And if so, then the Scriptural
means of Christian edification scarcely seem, in the popular
sense of the word, &ldquo;simple;&rdquo; but rather most
elaborate.&mdash;By Divine direction, we see a Society of men
enrolled, a community essentially distinct from every human one,
and therefore exciting much jealousy.&nbsp; To certain of the
body a Power is given of receiving or cutting off members; and
spiritual consequences of incalculable magnitude seem annexed to
the privilege of membership.&nbsp; The powers and prerogatives
possessed by these rulers are expressed also in language, however
obscure, yet, most solemn. (2 Cor. xiii. 10.)&nbsp; Whatever that
language may imply, (Matt, xviii. 18.; 1 Cor. v. 5.) it is
certainly Scriptural.&nbsp; There are very weighty expressions in
the <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Bible, relative to the Christian Ministry; and the
Sectarian systems are so far from <i>needing</i> them, that they
all find them to be &ldquo;difficulties.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is
equally certain that they mean something.&nbsp; Now, without
inquiring here what they do mean, we primarily point out their
evident incongruity with a theory which makes individuals every
thing, and the Church and Her powers nothing.&nbsp; We would
point out that they are quite needless, and even impediments to
that brief system which tells a man it is enough to &ldquo;take
his Bible and pray for the personal assistance of the <span
class="smcap">Holy Spirit</span>, and judge for
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is quite certain that had the New
Testament contained not one word about a Church, a &ldquo;washing
with water,&rdquo; a &ldquo;laying on of hands,&rdquo; a
partaking &ldquo;of <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span>
bread,&rdquo; and the like; the systems of Rationalists might
still be just what they are.&nbsp; They who reduce Christianity
to a code of principles, would lose nothing, by the blotting out
of every text containing any trace of Christian Church authority
from the Scriptures.&nbsp; And must not any hypothesis of
Christianity which is thus partial, be suspected as possibly not
commensurate with the Divine teaching of our Heavenly
Master?&nbsp; Let us not be mistaken as if we said, that there
are not &ldquo;doctrines&rdquo; to be believed, and
&ldquo;principles&rdquo; to be inculcated in Christianity; we
only insist that such a statement does <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>not contain
a complete idea of Christianity, and if taken alone, contains a
positively false, because inadequate idea.&nbsp; And it is
necessary to see the extreme danger of theorizing, where we ought
simply to believe, lest our theory should be more compact than
complete, more simple than true.</p>
<p>But let us attempt now still further to review the whole
subject in an analytical and practical way, apart from theories,
though it be at the risk of prolixity or tautology.&nbsp; Observe
how the Catholic Religion embraces simply and honestly the view
of truth just as it is historically presented in the
Scriptures.&nbsp; At the beginning of the Gospel, the Baptist
announces &ldquo;the kingdom of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo; at hand.&nbsp; Soon The Great
<span class="smcap">Teacher</span> appears,&mdash;<span
class="smcap">God</span> and Man in One Person.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">He</span> preaches truths and corrects
errors;&mdash;but is that all?&nbsp; Does <span
class="smcap">He</span> leave the truth to propagate
itself?&nbsp; Or is it simply a system of Divine Principles,
which <span class="smcap">He</span> inculcates?&nbsp; Or, has
<span class="smcap">He</span> not to establish the &ldquo;Kingdom
of heaven?&rdquo;&mdash;Yes, this Heavenly Personage, this no
common teacher or prophet, this <span class="smcap">Son</span> of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, had to found among men a
celestial community.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He</span> soon
began to incorporate a Visible society endowed with invisible
powers.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He</span> called twelve men,
and ordained them; declared that <span class="smcap">He</span>
appointed unto them &ldquo;a Kingdom even as His <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span><span
class="smcap">Father</span> had appointed unto <span
class="smcap">Him</span> a Kingdom;&rdquo; staid with them three
years; instructed them generally; &ldquo;manifested Himself unto
them otherwise than unto the world;&rdquo; gave them to see
&ldquo;mysteries of the kingdom of <span
class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; promised that they should
&ldquo;sit on twelve thrones&rdquo; as Vicegerents in the
spiritual dominion; and ere <span class="smcap">He</span> left
them, &ldquo;breathed on them&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;gave them the
Holy Ghost,&rdquo; accompanying it with most extraordinary
words&mdash;told them to &ldquo;baptize, and teach whatsoever
<span class="smcap">He</span> had commanded&rdquo;&mdash;and
promised to send His <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> to guide
them, and in some exalted sense to be <span
class="smcap">Himself</span> &ldquo;with them&rdquo; (Matt,
xxvii.) to the world&rsquo;s end.&mdash;Acting literally on His
instructions, the Apostles no sooner received the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> promised, than they proceeded to set
up their spiritual kingdom: First setting forth the truth,
according to their Master&rsquo;s example; then enrolling all who
received it as members of their new Society, by means of that
literal rite which had been Divinely commanded.&nbsp; And
literally did the Apostles accept the statement of their <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, that <span class="smcap">He</span> had
given to them &ldquo;a Kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did any man receive
their doctrine?&mdash;immediately he was addressed in terms like
unto the &ldquo;follow Me&rdquo; of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, &ldquo;Arise and be <span
class="smcap">Baptized</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;have fellowship
with us&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Be ye followers of us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So systematically at first did they keep &ldquo;together,&rdquo;
&ldquo;with one accord,&rdquo; <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>until much people was &ldquo;added
unto them.&rdquo; (Acts ii. 41&ndash;47.)&nbsp; So naturally did
they assume, <a name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a> and the people allow, their heavenly
rule, and Power, that at the outset, as far as possible, every
matter of consequence to the new community was transacted by
them, personally.&nbsp; Was property sold for the
poor?&mdash;&ldquo;they brought the money and laid it at the
Apostles&rsquo; feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were distributions made to the
needy?&mdash;the Apostles themselves did it, as matter of course;
till finding it too burdensome, at their own suggestion deputies
were appointed for the work.&nbsp; Were new converts added? or
did any thing of consequence transpire in distant parts? even in
&ldquo;matters of discipline,&rdquo; and &ldquo;outward forms and
ceremonies?&rdquo;&mdash;it was &ldquo;reported to the Apostles
and Elders at Jerusalem.&rdquo; (Acts xv. 2.)&nbsp; And when, in
time, Christian communities multiplied in remoter regions, beyond
the immediate personal inspection of the Apostles, and their
chief companions, subordinate Rulers were instituted; while an
Apostle having &ldquo;the care of all the Churches,&rdquo;
travelled from place to place as the organ of the Apostolic
government; <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>visiting again and again the various Christian
Societies; giving them the Apostolic traditions (2 Thess. ii.
15.) and directions, &ldquo;leaving them the decrees for to
keep.&rdquo; (Acts xvi. 4.)&nbsp; So indefatigable were the
Apostles in carrying out the arrangements of their spiritual
kingdom, and so prominent a part of their teaching was this
notion of spiritual sovereignty and power, that even their
enemies were struck by it, and charged them with setting up
another &ldquo;king, one <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>&rdquo;
(a charge which would never be brought by unbelievers against the
mere teachers of new principles <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a>).&nbsp; They
taught everywhere, that a membership of their spiritual
&ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; was necessary to all who would enjoy its
peculiar privileges. (Acts ii. 41, 47; 1 John i. 3, 5; ii.
19.)&nbsp; And that membership was attained in the One only way
which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> appointed, namely, by
Baptism.&nbsp; So that even a new Apostle, fresh called by <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> voice from heaven, was not
deemed a member, or in a state of spiritual privilege with <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>them&mdash;his &ldquo;sins not washed
away,&rdquo;&mdash;till he was baptized.&nbsp; As it was said to
St. Paul himself, &ldquo;Arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sins.&rdquo; (Acts xxii. 16.)&nbsp; All the baptized people,
that is, the Christians, or the &ldquo;Church&rdquo; of every
place, were commanded to &ldquo;meet together&rdquo; at stated
times.&nbsp; And among those baptized communities, marvellous
gifts abounded, which were exercised in their assemblies in a
most wonderful manner. (1 Cor. xiv.)&nbsp; But the most gifted of
these were alike subjected to the Apostles.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any
man,&rdquo; said St. Paul, &ldquo;be spiritual,&rdquo; still let
him submit.&mdash;All this, in point of fact, was the manner in
which the Apostles acted out the directions of their Master, in
establishing the &ldquo;kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, mark in what manner the Apostles put forth, by
degrees, their latent spiritual powers.&nbsp; We saw that on the
necessity arising, assistants in some minor matters were
appointed; but the <i>Apostles</i> suggested it.&nbsp; And these
assistants (named Deacons) had thereupon the full power of the
Apostles, for executing a certain commission; but no more.&nbsp;
They were the servants of the Apostles and of the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>; not endowed with the full grace of
Apostolicity, but with specific authority to execute certain
duties in the Apostles&rsquo; names.&nbsp; <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Had the
Apostles found it necessary to appoint other officers, doubtless
they would have done it; and so indeed they did, as necessity
arose.&nbsp; They &ldquo;appointed Elders in every city,&rdquo;
(Acts xiv. 23; Tit. i. 5.) still, by letters if not by other
means, retaining their own spiritual supremacy over all these
scattered communities; here and there, by degrees only, placing a
Spiritual Ruler, endowed with full Apostolic power&mdash;just as
Timothy was &ldquo;sent&rdquo; to Ephesus, and Titus &ldquo;left
in Crete,&rdquo; (Tit. i. 4, 5.) to take the oversight and charge
of the Churches and their general teachers.&nbsp; Thus from year
to year, with more and more of regularity, arose the kingdom of
heaven on earth.</p>
<p>It was indeed a mighty system rising throughout the world, and
reduced by slow degrees to regularity and form.&nbsp; But two
points seem settled and clear from the very first,&mdash;the
necessity of Baptism to membership in the Community, and the
necessity of the Apostles&rsquo; sanction to <i>every</i> thing
in the Community Universal. <a name="citation123"></a><a
href="#footnote123" class="citation">[123]</a>&nbsp; And these
two points being as clear and undeniable as any can possibly be,
they simplify and make plain many of the supposed difficulties of
that unformed state of things, which must have presented itself
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>first of
all in the Christian societies.&nbsp; Supposing, for instance, it
were even made quite clear, that any Christian man, at first, was
permitted to administer Baptism (though there really is no proof
of this, but, on the contrary, a great deal against it), yet,
knowing, as we do for certain, the Supremacy of the Apostles, we
may be sure that no such thing would have been practised without
their temporary sanction.&nbsp; The same Apostles who gave
Deacons a portion of their power, to &ldquo;minister to the
necessities of saints,&rdquo; might if they thought fit have
given to other Christians, permission to Baptize, in their
absence.&nbsp; And this might be more readily accorded to those
private Christians who had, as so many had, supernatural
gifts.&nbsp; But it took, and plainly must have taken, many years
to reduce to uniform order so far spread and rapidly-risen a
system as that of the Christian Church.&nbsp; It would take time
to ascertain in remote parts the will of the Apostles; and in the
interim, doubtless, many confusions would naturally arise,
especially in those scarcely-formed Communities which perhaps had
no settled Elders or Deacons, much less Bishops.&nbsp; Since,
then, the principle is clear, that every Baptized man was held to
be a subject of the Apostles&rsquo; dominion, i.e. the
&ldquo;kingdom of heaven&rdquo; or Church, it is plain, that the
validity of any act of a ministerial kind would be derived from
the <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Apostolical permission.&nbsp; And it is on this
principle, and this alone, that Lay-Baptism can be said to have
had any Primitive sanction.&nbsp; In so far as the Apostle, and
afterwards the Bishop, might allow it, it might have a <i>pro
tanto</i> validity; and so the Bishop was deemed to complete
Baptism by laying on his hands in Confirmation. (Acts viii.
17)&nbsp; Such is the language of the early Fathers, not only
with respect to Baptism, but every other matter; as for instance,
Marriage, which could not be sanctified by Roman Registrars had
such existed, but was reckoned base and unchristian unless it had
the Bishop&rsquo;s sanction.</p>
<p>From all this you perceive, that, strictly speaking, there is,
in theory, but One Order of Ministers necessary to <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> Church, and that Order, as it
consisted of Apostles at first, so it does now of those whom the
Apostles left as their Successors, just as <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> left Them.&nbsp; The Apostles, it
seems, thought fit not to delegate their full authority to many,
but only to here one and there one.&nbsp; They might have
constituted a plenary Successor of themselves in every
congregation of the Baptized, and have created no other Order of
Ministers; but they did not so.&nbsp; In that case every ordained
man must have been a Bishop, and capable of ordaining
others.&nbsp; But the general Unity of their <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>kingdom
would have been interfered with by such a subdivision into petty
provinces.&nbsp; Doubtless they were led by the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span> of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
and His own pattern when among them, to adopt another course; and
they created officers with derived and partial powers, to
exercise them to a certain extent and no farther.&nbsp; First,
they allowed certain persons to Baptize; and then, very soon,
they farther permitted others to consecrate the Holy Eucharist
and rule the Congregation, and use, in their absence, the powers
of binding and loosing souls; of which latter we have on record
one very solemn instance: (1 Cor. iv. 5.) &ldquo;In the name of
our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, when ye are
gathered together, <i>and my Spirit</i>&mdash;<i>with</i> the
Power of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
deliver such an one unto Satan.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. Paul thus
commissioning others in his absence to act in his name and <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>.&nbsp; But there was yet one
exercise of power which the Apostles reserved to themselves and
those of their Coadjutors who, by the voice of all Antiquity,
became their Successors in the Church, and that was the power of
&ldquo;laying on of hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus was accomplished
and set in order, by Divine Inspiration, that Threefold Ministry,
shadowed forth in <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> own
lifetime, and which has continued ever since.</p>
<p>In the specific reservation of this Power of imparting <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>, which the Apostles made to
themselves, there is a sacred beauty and fitness, on which, for a
moment, we shall do well to meditate.&mdash;By retaining in the
possession of themselves, and a chosen few, the whole power of
spiritually Commissioning the Ministers of the Church, they
effectually provided for the Unity and subordination of their
kingdom, and ensured the reverent estimation of their unseen
powers, as Vicars of a Heavenly Master.&nbsp; And then this was
still farther secured by the retention of the power of
Confirmation.&nbsp; For by this it came to pass that every member
of the Universal Church, every individual subject of the
&ldquo;kingdom of heaven,&rdquo; came necessarily into personal
contact, so to speak, with him who was the immediate
representative of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Thus
was recognised, in a degree, that intimate union with Apostles or
Apostolical men, the contemplation of which in its fulness raised
in after days all the eloquent aspirations of St. John
Chrysostom.&nbsp; Thus immediately from the hands of Apostles and
their Successors every Christian man receives to this hour the
higher blessings of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&mdash;There was a fatherly affection
in the appointment; as if the Holy Apostles were anxious, and
their Successors after them, to see with their own eyes each one
of the uncounted multitude of the great Catholic family. (Acts
xx. 28.)</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>It
must not be thought, however, that the ceremony of &ldquo;laying
on of hands&rdquo; was in itself essential either to Confirmation
or Ordination. <a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; For it is conceivable that any
other ceremony might have been adopted.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Intention</span> constituted the act of conveyance
of the grace of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, not only in
Confirmation, but in Ordination.&nbsp; Otherwise indeed there
would be no distinction between the two.&nbsp; So St. Matthias
was ordained &ldquo;by lot;&rdquo;&mdash;and the first Apostles
themselves by <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
&ldquo;breathing on them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Otherwise, also, Holy
Orders, [if not Confirmation too], would be a proper Sacrament,
which it is not, because it was not by <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> essentially tied to any form;
although it is now virtually so to us by Universal consecrated
usage in the Church.&nbsp; In thus speaking of the intention of
the Apostles as constituting the validity and essence of the Gift
which they conferred, (which it plainly must have done, else all
distinctions would have been destroyed, and whenever they laid
their hands even on a Deacon, or Deaconess, or a child, full
Apostolical grace must have been given, whether they meant it or
not; which is absurd,)&mdash;it must not be misunderstood as
though it were meant to support any Romish Doctrine of
Intention.&nbsp; It is just the reverse.&nbsp; For if Holy Orders
[or Confirmation] <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>were a proper Sacrament, it would have a positive grace
specifically annexed to a positive <i>form</i>, superseding all
intention on the part of the agent.&nbsp; Neither, again, must it
be taken to mean that the intention of any particular Bishop is
now necessary, to his official action, to secure its validity, as
the medium of grace.&nbsp; We are not speaking of any thing
personal and private, but of that which may be gathered from the
heaven-guided practice&mdash;the official and authoritative
intention&mdash;of the Founders of the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>, in this matter, which has ever,
<i>in fact</i>, descended to the Bishops, and is not now a
mutable thing.&nbsp; Before the decease of the Apostles,
&ldquo;laying on of hands&rdquo; had become the recognised
ceremony of Ordination and Confirmation; and so at length, the
Apostle St. Paul, in his later years (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 64, or 65), speaks of the <span
class="GutSmall">DOCTRINE</span> &ldquo;of laying on of
hands,&rdquo; (Heb. vi. 2,) which by that time was a known and
admitted point of rudimental Christianity.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the Apostolic career the Christian system
universal seemed to have become thus arranged with general
uniformity of discipline: so that after the destruction of
Jerusalem, according to the prophecy, &ldquo;before that
generation passed away,&rdquo; the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Son</span> of Man came in His kingdom,&rdquo; with
more of fulness, completeness, and <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>glory than heretofore.&nbsp; While,
in the early history of the Acts of the Apostles, we see the
elements of the Christian kingdom gradually assembled and
composed, neither reason nor history justify us in looking for
the complete system of the Apostles until towards the close of
their career.&nbsp; Even the extant Epistles to the Churches,
seem to indicate various stages in the development of the
Christian System. (1 Thess. iii. 10, 11; 1 Cor. xi. 34.)&nbsp;
The Apostles imparted of their powers, for the edification of the
Body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, just as necessity
arose and Churches spread, and miracles and gifts supernatural
became less frequent.&nbsp; And when they left the world, they
left their perpetual power to appointed Successors, in all the
great departments of the Spiritual kingdom; bequeathing likewise
the promise of the great King of saints, &ldquo;Lo I am with you
always.&rdquo;&mdash;And so, at last, (to return to the metaphor
of our text,) &ldquo;All the building was fitly framed
together,&rdquo; and grew &ldquo;into an Holy Temple in the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the clear historical view of Christianity, and the
statement of it is an analytical statement of the Catholic
Religion from the beginning.&nbsp; We do not find the facts of
Scripture and History to be &ldquo;difficulties.&rdquo;&mdash;But
let us now, finally, endeavour to combine what has been said, and
briefly <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>consider, in a more synthetical way, our whole
Christianity, as it lies before us both in the Gospels and
Epistles.</p>
<p>In the former, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is
instructing His Apostles and witnessing to the Jews.&nbsp; In the
latter, the Apostles, &ldquo;in the person of Christ&rdquo; (2
Cor. ii. 10), &ldquo;as though Christ did it by them&rdquo; (2
Cor. v. 20.), are instructing the <span
class="smcap">Churches</span>, and through them witnessing to the
world.&nbsp; The general impression wrought on the mind by the
Gospel narrative of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and His
followers, is that of an isolated company of men, having little
in common with those by whom they were surrounded, and among whom
they moved, as bent on some unearthly enterprise.&nbsp; And in
like manner, the impression left by the perusal of an Apostolic
Epistle is, of a separated band, a &ldquo;peculiar people,&rdquo;
in the midst of a world &ldquo;lying in
wickedness.&rdquo;&mdash;Looking a little closer, we soon
recognize a Purity of principle and a Divine mystery alike
unsearchable.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself in
the Gospel speaks with a heavenly emphasis of those who are
endowed with a certain high character, as &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">BLESSED</span>;&rdquo; telling us that
&ldquo;their&rsquo;s is the Kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
every Epistle opens with an exalted delineation of the like
persons&mdash;the &ldquo;elect,&rdquo; the &ldquo;called,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;sanctified,&rdquo; the &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">BLESSED</span> in <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span><span class="smcap">Christ
Jesus</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They who were so addressed were
deemed, in a lofty sense, already the heirs of <span
class="smcap">God</span> and &ldquo;joint-heirs with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo; having &ldquo;received power
to become sons of <span class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo; (John i.
12.), and having been Baptismally &ldquo;born of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo; (1 John iii. 9.)&nbsp; Each had
a Sacred character, yet not as an individual, but as a member of
a Sacred Body.&nbsp; Among them there were distinctions, and yet
there was an identity; &ldquo;diversity of gifts,&rdquo; but
Oneness of grace.&nbsp; They were &ldquo;all members one of
another,&rdquo; but &ldquo;all members had not the same
office;&rdquo; they were &ldquo;one,&rdquo; they were
&ldquo;brethren&rdquo; in <span class="smcap">Christ</span> (as
He had commanded them to be); but some were to
&ldquo;rule,&rdquo; and some to &ldquo;submit;&rdquo; some to
&ldquo;overlook&rdquo; and &ldquo;watch,&rdquo; and some to
&ldquo;obey.&rdquo;&mdash;And the idea of the Oneness of
Christians, (and the mysterious nature of it,) seems to pervade
the whole New Testament, and is that which forces itself upon our
attention, open it wherever we may.&nbsp; Not only did <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> pray to His <span
class="smcap">Father</span> for this, but He appointed a
Mysterious ordinance, by which His people were to become One
Body: And another more mysterious still, by which their Oneness
might be Divinely sustained.&nbsp; &ldquo;By <span
class="GutSmall">ONE</span> <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> ye
are Baptized into <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span> body;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;know ye not that the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>
of <span class="smcap">God</span> dwelleth in you?&rdquo; said
St. Paul; as if intimating somewhat which the Baptized might
apprehend, but which could not <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>be spoken.&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;I
speak as to wise men,&rdquo; said the same holy Apostle to the
Corinthian Church&mdash;glancing only, as it were, at The Mystery
of unutterable grace&mdash;&ldquo;I speak as to wise men; judge
ye what I say.&nbsp; The Cup of blessing which <span
class="GutSmall">WE</span> bless, is it not the <span
class="GutSmall">COMMUNION</span> of the <span
class="GutSmall">BLOOD</span> of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>?&nbsp; The Bread which <span
class="GutSmall">WE</span> break, is it not the <span
class="GutSmall">COMMUNION</span> of the <span
class="GutSmall">BODY</span> of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he
adds&mdash;passing from our Union with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> to our Communion with all Saints by
means of the Most Holy Eucharist, &ldquo;We are <span
class="GutSmall">ONE</span> body, . . . <i>for</i> we are all
partakers of that <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span>
Bread!&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the judgment of the same Apostle, no
language seemed too severe to condemn the willing violaters of
this Union.&nbsp; It was sacrilege to injure the least of the
members; how much more then to divide the Body?&nbsp; That the
Baptized were &ldquo;One with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;that the Communicating
believer was already, as it were, linked with the verities of
eternity,&mdash;were transcendent Mysteries; not bare metaphors,
but earthly forms of stating Heavenly Truths.&nbsp; And if every
member of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was thus sacredly
looked on, so the more also was the whole Body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
are a chosen generation,&rdquo; says St. Peter, &ldquo;a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.&rdquo;&mdash;Every
Christian indeed was a &ldquo;Temple of the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>:&rdquo; but as S. Clement of
Alexandria saith, the <span class="smcap">Church</span> is <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> great <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Temple&mdash;&ldquo;builded together for an habitation
of <span class="smcap">God</span> through the <span
class="smcap">Spirit</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, is opened to us the great Catholic idea of the
Christian Revelation&mdash;That the mystical <span
class="smcap">Company</span> of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> people, as such, were clothed
with the heavenly Powers, and &ldquo;blessed with the heavenly
blessings.&rdquo;&mdash;It was in the temple &ldquo;builded
together&rdquo; that the Divine glory vouchsafed to
dwell.&mdash;To the Church, the elect assembly, the promises had
been made.&nbsp; To the <span class="smcap">Body</span>, when in
solemn meeting, the special and highest grace of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> had been granted; (and so at the
appointed &ldquo;gatherings together&rdquo; <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a> the Blessed Eucharist was usually
celebrated.)&mdash;From the beginning of the Gospel this had been
indicated, so that even the instituted Apostolate arose, as at
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> command, out of the
<span class="smcap">Church</span>, more as the Divine instrument
of Her invisible power, than the possessor of aught in itself. <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a>&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> words, &ldquo;Thou art
Peter,&rdquo; were instantly connected with the promise of
building the <span class="smcap">Church</span> against which
&ldquo;the gates of hell should not prevail.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
commission, &ldquo;Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them, and whose soever sins ye retain, they are
retained,&rdquo; was instantly followed by words <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>conveying
this power of absolving and condemning, to the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>, and not to the <i>persons</i> of the
Apostles, <a name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a> except as <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> instruments <i>in</i> the <span
class="smcap">Church</span>; &ldquo;<i>for</i>&rdquo; it is
directly added, &ldquo;where two or three are <i>gathered
together</i> in <span class="smcap">My</span> name, there am
I.&rdquo;&nbsp; In accordance with which declaration, we see (in
a passage before quoted) that an Apostolic condemnation of a
sinner was pronounced.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the name of the <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, when ye (i.e. the Church)
are <i>gathered together</i>&rdquo; (1 Cor. v. 4.)&nbsp; In like
manner we may trace how, from the first, the highest Authority,
as well as sacredness and favour, (Luke xxiv. 33.) was attributed
to the &ldquo;assembling together&rdquo; of Christians, which
therefore they were urged &ldquo;not to forsake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus when the door of faith was first &ldquo;opened to the
Gentiles,&rdquo; the Church was &ldquo;<i>gathered
together</i>&rdquo;, (Acts xiv. 27.) and the matter
rehearsed.&nbsp; When the question of Judaizing arose, again
&ldquo;the Apostles <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>and Elders <i>came
together</i>&rdquo; (Acts xv. 6.)&nbsp; When the Apostle St.
Peter was to be miraculously delivered from prison, &ldquo;there
were many <i>gathered together</i> praying&rdquo; for him. (Acts
xii. 12.)&nbsp; The announcement of the risen <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> had been made to the &ldquo;eleven
<i>gathered together</i>&rdquo; (Luke xxiv. 33.)&nbsp; And the
blessings attendant on these united assemblings was not to be
disturbed by Jewish or Gentile jealousies.&nbsp; Since, they had
all been &ldquo;quickened <i>together</i>, and raised up
<i>together</i>, and made to sit <i>together</i> in heavenly
places in <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.&rdquo; (Eph.
ii. 5.)&nbsp; And so Christians might be addressed as
&ldquo;heirs <i>together</i> of the grace of life;&rdquo; (1 Pet.
iii. 7.) exhorted to be &ldquo;followers <i>together</i>&rdquo;
of the Apostles; (Phil. iii. 17.) and admonished to &ldquo;strive
<i>together</i>&rdquo; for the &ldquo;faith of the
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majestic privileges of the Saints, in Union with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> and Communion with one another, if we
contemplated them aright, would so overwhelm our spirits, that we
could not think of the &ldquo;solemn assemblies&rdquo; without
coveting to be there!&nbsp; Little as it is thought of, there is
a special awfulness in the &ldquo;meeting together&rdquo; of the
members of this Heavenly, yet earthly,&mdash;this Invisible, yet
visible&mdash;Society; when <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Eye is on every one, when <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, though unseen, is &ldquo;in the
midst,&rdquo;&mdash;and the &ldquo;hosts of God&rdquo; are
encamping <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>around!&nbsp; All Christians then constituting, in some
sacred and lofty sense, a &ldquo;kingdom of Priests;&rdquo; <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a>&mdash;yet ministering only through
that Consecrated organ which <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
the great High Priest, appointed,&mdash;the Bishop, or his
representative.&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> is
very greatly to be feared in the Council of the Saints! and to be
had in reverence of all that are round about <span
class="smcap">Him</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;Well might the ancient
Fathers delight to speak of the dignity of being a
Christian!&nbsp; It is observable, however, for our instruction
and warning, even in this, that Tertullian, after he embraced the
Montanist heresy, carried out so erroneously the idea we have
been dwelling on, as to assign to any Christian, in cases of
necessity, the exercise of inherent Priestly functions.&nbsp;
Such, even then, was the perilous rashness of Private
Judgment.&nbsp; For though the Priestly functions are doubtless
in the <span class="smcap">Church</span>, granted unto Her for
Her blessedness and perfection (1 Cor. iii. 22.); and though in
our Solemn Assemblies &ldquo;all the people of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> are holy,&rdquo; all the Baptized in
such wise sharers of the Priesthood, that they join in our
&lsquo;sacred offerings;&rsquo; yet, we must beware of the
&ldquo;gainsaying of Core.&rdquo; (Jude 11.)&nbsp; The Catholic
Church has ever held that Her Priesthood cannot be effectually
exercised otherwise <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>than in conformity with the original
commands and ordinations of Christ.&nbsp; And from <span
class="smcap">Him</span> alone the first Ministers of the Church
derived their appointment, (St. Paul speaking of <span
class="GutSmall">HIS</span> as &ldquo;the Ministry received <span
class="smcap">of the Lord</span>:&rdquo; See also Col. iv. 17.),
and afterwards conveyed it to others, whom they had chosen, and
on whom they &ldquo;laid their hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus St.
Paul, while anxious to <i>vindicate and prove to the Church</i>,
as the constituent body, his right to the Ministry, at the same
time scruples not to claim and exercise its loftiest Powers <i>as
his own</i>, (2 Cor. xiii. 10) and commands the Church&rsquo;s
obedience. . . .&nbsp; So mysteriously is &ldquo;all the building
fitly framed together, and groweth into an Holy Temple in the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here let us pause: Let any man recall, in thought, the
Scripture language concerning the <span
class="smcap">Church&rsquo;s</span> privileges, and the <span
class="smcap">Ministerial Prerogatives</span>; let him compare it
with all that has now been said; then let his mind revert to the
notions of the Rationalist; and draw his own
conclusion;&mdash;And whatever his personal <i>belief</i> may be,
he will hardly fail to perceive, that the system which is every
where supposed throughout the New Testament, differs from a mere
code of principles to be &ldquo;applied&rdquo; to
individuals&mdash;differs <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span><i>in kind</i>,&mdash;as widely as
the mysterious and appointed Sacrifice of Abel differs from the
Rational devotion of Cain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">May God</span> give us grace to weigh
these things; and &ldquo;that not lightly, or after the manner of
dissemblers with <span class="smcap">Him</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some, who are not yet members of the Church, may be wishing,
perhaps, to put these thoughts far from them, sustaining
themselves with the belief, that they <i>have</i> partaken of
Christian blessings apart from the Church; and similar
reflections.&nbsp; We only say to them, that self-deception on
such a matter is but too easy!&nbsp; And if that be true which we
have now literally taken from <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word, then it is certain that
they are, at the best, in a very deficient state, and &ldquo;come
behind in many a good gift!&rdquo;&nbsp; More than this might
indeed be said, without overstepping truth or charity: for those
who have heard these things, cannot afterwards be as though they
had not.&nbsp; But let each think of it for himself.&nbsp;
Whatever may be said of those who are unwittingly out of the
&ldquo;kingdom of heaven&rdquo; below, unbaptized, or only
doubtfully baptized by some one who had only his <i>own</i>
authority to do it; whatever be thought of the present amount of
grace, or future reward of such, if they go on according to their
best, in the course they find themselves in,&mdash;<a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>some of
them haply verging on the very borders of our land of
promise,&mdash;far different is <i>their</i> case who
<i>might</i> have known and embraced the truth.&nbsp; To such we
say, in <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> words,
&ldquo;Verily the kingdom of <span class="smcap">God</span> is
come nigh unto you!&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; The foolish virgins in the
parable <i>thought</i> their lamps seemed to burn brightly, and
emulated the light of the heavenly-wise; but when the Bridegroom
came, they were found unsupplied with the needful oil, and went
out in utter darkness!</p>
<p>But let not those who are of the &ldquo;household of
faith&rdquo; be self-confident!&nbsp; &ldquo;By the grace of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, we are what we are!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And let the consciousness of our sinful neglect stir us up to
pray for the fuller restoration of the Church&rsquo;s grace to us
Her degenerate children.&nbsp; It is of little value to believe
in a Priesthood, without we <i>use</i> it.&nbsp; May <span
class="smcap">God</span> forgive His Priests and people for their
joint forgetfulness of their many unearthly privileges!&mdash;the
very belief whereof seemed a short time since almost dying away
from very disuse!&nbsp; Of a truth, we of the English Church are
blessed beyond others, would we but apprehend our
privileges!&nbsp; Brought nigh, as we are, to our <span
class="smcap">Lord Christ</span>, with such abundant mercy and
undeserved!&nbsp; If we come short of plenary grace in <span
class="smcap">Him</span>, what shall we dare to plead in the Day
of account?</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;What manner of persons ought we to be?&rdquo;
for we have &ldquo;come unto the City of the Living <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
innumerable company of Angels; to the general Assembly and Church
of the first-born enrolled in heaven!&mdash;to <span
class="smcap">God</span> the Judge of all, and to the spirits of
the perfected just; and to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> the
<span class="smcap">Mediator</span> of the New Testament, and to
the blood of sprinkling!&rdquo;&mdash;Would that the feeling of
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> first disciples were
ours!&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to whom else
shall we go?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thou</span> hast the words
of eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would that we were more thankful to
<span class="smcap">God</span> for the present blessings of His
Church!&nbsp; Would that we used our Prayers, and tried them
well, before we talked of amending them; or understood our holy
offices, instead of seeking to shorten them!&mdash;Have we now,
in this late century, to seek out new faith&mdash;some new
instructor or guide?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> deliver
us from this blindness!&nbsp; May <span class="smcap">He</span>
help His people to see what treasures of unknown grace lie hidden
in His Holy Church among us!&nbsp; &ldquo;We have all and
abound.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us only &ldquo;give diligence&rdquo;
thereto, that when <span class="smcap">Christ</span> cometh,
&ldquo;we may be found of Him in peace, without spot and
blameless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I have loved the
Habitation of <span class="smcap">Thy</span> House, and the place
where <span class="GutSmall">THINE</span> honour
dwelleth!&rdquo;&mdash;So holy David could say from the very <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>depths of
his soul: and shall we who are brought into a holier place,
&ldquo;the Habitation of <span class="smcap">God</span> through
the <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>,&rdquo; be forbidden to
give utterance to as ardent a love&mdash;a devotion as deep and
pure?&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">O holy Church of England</span>!&nbsp;
Brightest and fairest province of the realm of heaven on
earth!&nbsp; What shining paths of truth and holiness are
Thine!&mdash;And they are thronged by all Thy many Saints,

prayers we pray to the <span class="smcap">Eternal Father</span>
of all&mdash;in whose Psalms &ldquo;we praise <span

145</span>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>No. I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems alike congruous to human
nature, and consistent with every Divine dispensation to say,
that man is more effectually influenced by the personal
instrumentality of his fellow man, than by any other means.&nbsp;
Statesmen and politicians seem to have seen this; and in every
age have acted upon it; and have thought it necessary to give
their sanction and support to a priesthood, even for the
attainment of worldly ends.&nbsp; The lower classes of the
community also, bear unequivocal testimony to the same
truth&mdash;the suitability of the living Priesthood as the
effective means of influencing human nature.&nbsp; Even among
those classes of our own people, who affect to make light of the
authority of the Ministry, it is remarkable how much that
authority is <i>felt</i> after all; and how much even the
systematic rejecters of the established Priesthood, are
accustomed to impute high power and efficacy to the
ministrations, and often to the very persons, of their own
self-sent ministers.&nbsp; Books have their use&mdash;but Man
directly influences man, in a more vital way.</p>
<p>And more than this.&nbsp; Some men <i>naturally</i> influence
their fellows more than others: and some men <i>Divinely</i>;
that is by Divine appointment.&nbsp; It is true, for instance,
that by the very necessity of our social nature and condition, we
affect one another in a very important degree; and that it is
even a duty sometimes to exert our moral influence on our <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>brethren.&nbsp; And the degree in which we are able to
accomplish this, will be variously determined.&nbsp; But beyond
the natural influence which we thus exercise, there is an
instituted influence, as much a matter of <i>fact</i> as the
former.&nbsp; Keeping to the religious view of this question
only, I would thus further explain:</p>
<p>It is evident that in every age, one man may be a blessing to
another, by personally instructing him to the best of his power:
or by praying for him, to Almighty <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Every good man may possess this
power of mediately blessing his fellow men; but some men more
than others.&mdash;A Howard may thus bless very
&ldquo;effectually.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, generally, the
&ldquo;effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; But some there have been in every age, who,
according to the Divine testimony, have had <span
class="GutSmall">POWER</span> to give authoritative blessing. (1
Sam. iii. 19.)&nbsp; Some have been from time to time appointed
and endowed by the <span class="smcap">Deity</span>, &ldquo;to
bless, and to curse, in the name of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo; (1 Chron. xxiii. 13.)&nbsp;
Generally this was the assigned function of the Priesthood, and
was declared to pertain to them &ldquo;for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
&ldquo;from the beginning it was so;&rdquo; Job blessed his three
friends, (Job xlii. 8.) and Noah his sons, (Gen. ix.) and before
the Levitical priesthood was set up, Melchisedec &ldquo;blessed
Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isaac &ldquo;blessed Jacob and could not
reverse it&rdquo; though he heartily wished to do so: and Joseph,
again, blessed his two sons, <i>officially</i>, and contrary to
his own intention. (Gen. xlviii. 9.)&nbsp; Balaam, we see, also,
was sent for to &ldquo;curse&rdquo; Israel, and he &ldquo;blessed
them altogether,&rdquo; though he wished not to do it: (Num.
xxii. 11.) so that it was no peculiar privilege of the Jewish
nation or their ancestors to be able to impart an authoritative
blessing. (Matt. xxiii. 3.)&nbsp; And we find the same to hold in
the Christian dispensation. (Acts x. 41.)&nbsp; Being reviled
&ldquo;we bless,&rdquo; said the Apostle.&nbsp; Say &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Peace</span> be to this house,&rdquo; was our <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> direction to His Ministers;
&ldquo;and if the Son of peace be there, <span
class="GutSmall">YOUR PEACE</span> shall rest upon
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that at the end of his epistles St. Paul
<i>sends</i> his <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Apostolic blessing &ldquo;under his own
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; And &ldquo;without all contradiction (he
argues) the less is blessed of the better.&rdquo; (Heb. vii.
7.&nbsp; Deut. xxi. 5; xxvii. 14.)&nbsp; All men can pray for
blessing, but <i>some</i> can &ldquo;bless.&rdquo;&nbsp; So,
every man can <i>read</i> &ldquo;the Absolution,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> hath given <span
class="GutSmall">POWER</span> and commandment to His <span
class="GutSmall">MINISTERS</span>, to declare and <span
class="GutSmall">PRONOUNCE</span> it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (So St. James
says, &ldquo;If any man (not, if any <i>poor</i> man, only, as
some seem to take it) be sick, let him call for the Priests of
the <span class="smcap">Church</span>.&rdquo;)&mdash;And this
depends not on the goodness of the <span
class="GutSmall">MAN</span>.&nbsp; A Judas was an Apostle.</p>
<p>Let any one follow out in his own mind these hints; and he
will see nothing either unphilosophical or unscriptural in
expecting in these days also the blessings of an instituted
Priesthood.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> plan
ever is, to use <i>men</i> as instruments of good to men.&nbsp;
Revelation has ever recognized such an institute as the living
Ministry.&nbsp; All infidelity is an attempt at
&ldquo;codification.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of the fourth Lecture
I have made some observations on the <span
class="smcap">Intention</span> of the Church Catholic, as
constituting, in a measure, the essence of the validity of
certain of Her Ordinances.&nbsp; It will be difficult to clear
this statement from the possibility of misrepresentation, and
even misapprehension: I would request that what I have said at p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page128">128</a></span>,
&amp;c. may be re-read and considered.&nbsp; The Doctrine of
Laying on of hands is recognized in Scripture; but there is no
command of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> concerning this, in
the same way that there is a command concerning Baptism and the
Eucharist.&nbsp; It seems an institute of the Apostles and the
Primitive Church; and may perhaps be looked on as an instance of
the early exercise of the Church&rsquo;s inherent power and
grace; for the institute certainly received the sanction of
Scripture, before the close of the Sacred Canon.&nbsp; So that it
would be impossible to say <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>how dangerous it might not be, to
depart from the Church&rsquo;s Ordinance of Laying on of
hands.&nbsp; I trust therefore that none will imagine, that what
is here said can fairly be made to sanction the loose notion,
that any part of the Church Catholic can now voluntarily
originate and ordain a Ministry in a <i>new</i> way; and without
imposition of hands.&nbsp; The uncertainty, not to say peril of
presumption in any such case, will be quite sufficient to guard
against the fatal folly of such a thought.&nbsp; How far the
grace of the Apostolate is ordinarily now allied even to the very
<i>act</i> of &ldquo;laying on of hands,&rdquo; it may be
impossible to say; still it is important in many respects to
observe, that the Laying on of hands is not so strictly of the
nature of a proper sacrament, as that the divine grace is always
necessarily allied to that form of ordination exclusively.&nbsp;
There is advantage in considering that in <i>theory</i> it may
not be so, though there could be no safety or certainty in
deliberately <i>acting</i> on such a doubtfully understood
theory.</p>
<p>Even the Roman Controversialists do not agree that the Laying
on of hands is <i>the</i> specifically Sacramental act;&mdash;the
outward form to which only of necessity the inward grace is
allied.&nbsp; Though I cannot help thinking that it would much
benefit their argument, if they were agreed on this point.&nbsp;
The Doctrine which attributes the essence of Ordination to the
uniform Intention of the Church Catholic may be, of course, very
easily cavilled at; but still even the Romanist must, to a
certain extent, rely on some such Doctrine, and such a Doctrine
is that, perhaps, which alone will harmonize the conflicting
Roman theories.&nbsp; In its very nature it is a Doctrine which
admits not of strict definition.&nbsp; It rises simply out of the
truth, that the gifts of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> were
to the <span class="smcap">Church</span>, and not primarily or
inherently in individuals, as such.</p>
<p>This theoretical conception of these ordinances will serve
greatly to assist us in meeting a theoretical difficulty, not
unfrequently brought against the Doctrine of the
Succession.&nbsp; It is said: &lsquo;Is it not very conceivable,
after all that has been urged, that during the long course of
ages, in <i>some</i> countries <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>at least, some one break in the
Apostolic chain <i>might</i> have occurred?&nbsp; Is it not a
consequence, in that case, that all subsequent Ordinations would
be very doubtful?&rsquo;&nbsp; To which we reply, &lsquo;Point
out <i>the fact</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; We challenge you to find it; a
bare supposition can have but little force as an argument.&nbsp;
And then, supposing the fact to be discovered, That a certain
Bishop had obtained his place in the Church by invalid
means&mdash;what is the consequence?&nbsp; Could he perpetuate
such an invalid Succession?&nbsp; Certainly not; for in Ordaining
others, he would be associated with <i>two</i> other Bishops,
whose valid grace would confer true Orders, notwithstanding the
inefficacy of the third coadjutor in the Ordination.&nbsp; But,
putting the case at the very worst, even if such an instance
could be found, it would only affect the condition of the single
Church over which the nominal Bishop presided; and that only so
far as the particular functions of that Bishop were concerned;
and it would be corrected at his death.&nbsp; And all this may be
urged in reply even by Romanists.&nbsp; But we who deny Holy
Orders to be a proper Sacrament of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, can add more than this.&nbsp; We
suggest, that in the case of a Bishop obtaining his place in the
Church by some invalid means, which the Church had mistaken for
valid, the Church&rsquo;s <span class="GutSmall">INTENTION</span>
might avail sufficiently, for the time being at least, to
counteract the effects of man&rsquo;s sin; and so give value even
to the ministrations of the Church which had been so severely
visited, as to have such a Bishop set over them.&nbsp; So we meet
the theoretical difficulty by a theoretical answer.</p>
<h3>III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not unusual with those who
are more anxious to make difficulties than to understand the
Catholic truth, to speak of the &ldquo;vagueness of the rule of
S. Vincent,&rdquo; and the arduousness of the task imposed by the
Doctors of the <i>Via Media</i> on all their scholars.&nbsp; That
it is easy enough to construct a theoretical <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>difficulty
of this sort, no one will question.&nbsp; But it behoves every
Christian to consider well, whether any &ldquo;dilemmas of
Churchmen&rdquo; can be stated which might not (without any very
great ingenuity) be turned into &lsquo;Dilemmas of <span
class="smcap">Christians</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Doubtless it is a
<i>trial</i>, (and <span class="smcap">God</span> intended it to
be so, 1 Cor. xi. 19.) to see so many diversities and divisions
in the Church; yet candid judges will hardly decide, that English
Churchmen have more difficulties of this kind than other men; or
that we should be likely to escape similar &ldquo;dilemmas&rdquo;
by forsaking the <span class="smcap">Church</span> for any other
community.&nbsp; And in spite of the ingenuity of men, common
sense will generally understand the practical use and application
of S. Vincent&rsquo;s rule, &ldquo;Quod semper,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; An instance of the ordinary manner of its practical
employment, may be seen, to a certain extent, in Lecture II. p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page51">51</a></span>, and
will suggest at once to the minds of many, the way in which the
English Churchman can and does proceed.&nbsp; Difficult as the
theory of the Via Media, and the popular recognition of truth by
S. Vincent&rsquo;s test may in theory be made to seem; yet it is,
I imagine, practically and as a matter of experience acted on, to
a much wider extent, both in our own Church and the <i>Roman</i>,
than is commonly noticed, or thought of.&nbsp; In illustration,
the twenty-first chapter of St. Luke might be advantageously
consulted.&nbsp; Our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> there
assumes (what in fact is daily seen) that heresies should
arise.&nbsp; And He tells His people not to follow the &ldquo;Lo
here is <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lo
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course it might always be easy to
say&mdash;which is <span class="smcap">the
Church</span>?&mdash;and, which is the heresy?&mdash;The
&ldquo;Lo here!&rdquo;&nbsp; But that is a difficulty which our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> did <i>not</i> entertain.&nbsp;
It has very little existence in fact and experience.&nbsp; Every
man, generally speaking, knows whether he is in &ldquo;the
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though, of course, there is such a thing as
a &ldquo;strong delusion;&rdquo; (2 Thess. ii. 11.)&nbsp; The
whole of our <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> address in
this chapter is one which the Catholic Church <i>feels</i> the
power of.&nbsp; It is full of &ldquo;<i>difficulty</i>,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;uncertainty, and vagueness,&rdquo; to Sectarians only,
who have no test whereby they can be sure that they are not the
very persons aimed at by our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>as
following false and <i>new</i> teachers.&nbsp; It seems to me,
that the Sectarian <i>cannot</i> act upon <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> directions in this
chapter.&nbsp; Nay they <i>must</i> have, to him, all the
vagueness and uncertainty which he charges on the Catholic
rule.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep to the ancient Apostolic way; mind not
novelties; &lsquo;Go not after them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Keep to the
&lsquo;Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus,&rsquo; in
opposition to every &lsquo;Lo here is Christ!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> holy Apostle St. Paul, good
children, in the tenth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans,
writeth on this fashion: &ldquo;Whosoever shall call upon the
name of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, shall be
saved.&nbsp; But how shall they call on Him on Whom they believe
not?&nbsp; How shall they believe on Him of Whom they have not
heard?&nbsp; How shall they hear without a preacher?&nbsp; How
shall they preach except they be Sent?&rdquo;&nbsp; By the which
words St. Paul doth evidently declare unto us two lessons.</p>
<p>The first is, that it is necessary to our salvation to have
Preachers and Ministers of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
most holy word, to instruct us in the true faith and
knowledge.</p>
<p>The second is, that Preachers must not run to this high honour
before they be called thereto, but they must be ordained and
appointed to this office, and sent to us by <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; For it is not possible to be
saved, or to please <span class="smcap">God</span>, without
faith; and no man can truly believe in <span
class="smcap">God</span> by his own wit, (for of ourselves we
know not what we should believe) but we must needs hear <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word taught us by other.</p>
<p>Again, the Teachers, except they be called and Sent, cannot
fruitfully teach.&nbsp; For the seed of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word doth never bring forth
fruit, unless the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of the harvest
do give increase, and by His <span class="smcap">Holy
Spirit</span> do work with the sower.&nbsp; But <span
class="smcap">God</span> doth not work with the preacher whom He
hath not sent, as St. Paul saith . . . <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Wherefore,
good children, to the intent you may steadfastly believe all
things which <span class="smcap">God</span> by His ministers doth
teach and promise unto you, and so be saved by your faith, learn
diligently I pray you, by what words our <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus Christ</span> gave this commission and commandment to His
ministers, and rehearse them here, word for word, that so you may
print them in your memories, and recite them the better when you
come home.&nbsp; The words of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
be these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span> breathed on
His disciples and said, Receive the <span class="smcap">Holy
Ghost</span>; whose sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them;
and whose sins you reserve, they are reserved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>. . . Now, good children, that you may the better understand
these words of our <span class="smcap">Saviour Christ</span>, you
shall know that our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>,
when He began to preach, He did call and choose His twelve
Apostles; and afterward, besides those twelve, He sent forth
threescore and ten disciples, and gave them authority to preach
the Gospel.&nbsp; And after <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> ascension, the Apostles gave
authority to other godly and holy men to minister <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word, and chiefly in those
places where there were Christian men already, which lacked
preachers, and the Apostles themselves could no longer abide with
them: for the Apostles did walk abroad into divers parts of the
world, and did study to plant the Gospel in many places.&nbsp;
Wherefore where they found godly men, and meet to preach <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word, they laid they hands upon
them, and gave them the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, as
they themselves received of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> the
same <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> to execute this
office.</p>
<p>And they that were so ordained, were indeed, and also were
called the ministers of <span class="smcap">God</span> as the
Apostles themselves were, as Paul saith unto Timothy.&nbsp; And
so the ministration of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
word (which our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>
Himself did first institute) was derived from the Apostles, unto
other after them, by imposition of hands and giving the <span
class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>, from the Apostles&rsquo; time to
our days.&nbsp; And this was the consecration, orders, and
unction of the Apostles, whereby they, at the beginning, <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>made
Bishops and Priests; and this shall continue in the Church, even
to the world&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>Wherefore, good children, you shall give due reverence and
honour to the Ministers of the Church, and shall not meanly or
lightly esteem them in the execution of their office, but you
shall take them for <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
Ministers, and the Messengers of our <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus Christ</span>.&nbsp; For <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
Himself saith in the Gospel, &ldquo;He that heareth you, heareth
<span class="smcap">Me</span>; and he that despiseth you,
despiseth <span class="smcap">Me</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wherefore,
good children, you shall steadfastly believe all those things,
which such Ministers shall speak unto you from the mouth and by
the commandment of our <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus
Christ</span>.&nbsp; And whatsoever They do to you, as when They
<span class="GutSmall">BAPTIZE</span> you, when They give you
<span class="GutSmall">ABSOLUTION</span>, and distribute to you
the <span class="GutSmall">BODY</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">BLOOD</span> of our <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus Christ</span>, these you shall so esteem as if <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself, in His own person, did speak
and minister unto you.&nbsp; For <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> hath commanded His ministers to do
this unto you, and He Himself (although you see Him not with your
bodily eyes) is present with His ministers, and worketh by the
<span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span> in the administration of
His Sacraments.&nbsp; And on the other side you shall take good
heed and beware of false and privy preachers, which privily creep
into cities, and preach in corners, having none authority, nor
being called to this office.&nbsp; For <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> is not present with such preachers,
and therefore doth not the <span class="smcap">Holy Ghost</span>
work by their preaching; but their word is without fruit or
profit, and they do great hurt in commonwealths.&nbsp; For such
as be not called of <span class="smcap">God</span>, they, no
doubt of it, do err, and sow abroad heresy and naughty
doctrine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cranmer&rsquo;s</span>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arguments used in p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page87">87</a></span>, <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page88">88</a></span>, &amp;c.
respecting the Priesthood of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
still manifesting the One Sacrifice of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>in the Church, may serve
incidentally to illustrate the error of the Romanists respecting
both the Priesthood and the Sacrifice.&nbsp; St. Paul certainly
implies that an <i>analogy</i> exists between the Ministers and
their functions in the respective Churches of the Jews and
Christians.&nbsp; And in implying an <i>analogy</i>, he evidently
takes for granted that there is not an <i>identity</i>.&nbsp; The
Romanist seems to overlook this: his error is truly a Judaizing
error; and it seems to result from a virtual forgetfulness, that
the <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span> great Sacrifice &ldquo;once
for all&rdquo; <i>has been</i> offered, and that the Christian
Priesthood has only continuously to &ldquo;manifest&rdquo;
it.&nbsp; In speaking of the &ldquo;Priesthood&rdquo; of the
Church, and the Eucharistic &ldquo;Sacrifice,&rdquo; we certainly
imply that the Christian Presbyter has truly holy functions to
perform, in respect of the great atoning Sacrifice,
<i>analogous</i> to those of the Jewish priest: but we must be
careful not to make them <i>identical</i>.&nbsp; St. Paul, in the
epistle to the Hebrews, evidently assumes the analogy, but his
argument is wholly inconsistent with the notion of
identity.&nbsp; The Christian Priest cannot
&ldquo;sacrifice,&rdquo; in a Jewish sense of the word; but in a
much better.&nbsp; So it may be truly said, that he has to
&ldquo;offer&rdquo; continually The Sacrifice once made by The
<span class="smcap">Divine High Priest</span>. (Gal. iii.
1.)&nbsp; But the term &ldquo;offering,&rdquo; among primitive
writers, is used <i>generally</i>; and does not exclusively refer
to the Consecrated Elements alone.&mdash;See note E. in the
former series of &ldquo;Parochial Lectures,&rdquo; on the Holy
Catholic Church.&nbsp; There is some historical light thrown on
our own Church&rsquo;s view of this subject by the volume just
published by the Principal of St. Alban&rsquo;s Hall, Oxford,
comparing the two Liturgies of King Edward VI.&mdash;Oxford,
1838.</p>

extent, may be seen in Judges xvii. 5, 6, 13. &amp;c.&nbsp; The
priesthood of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was associated
partly with idolatrous worship.&nbsp; Micah had graven images and
teraphim, yet he, with a Levite for a Priest, was partly blessed
by <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It is not for us to say
how far <span class="smcap">God</span> may bless those who are
not strictly obeying Him; nevertheless we must not calculate on
this.&nbsp; Obedience is still a duty.</p>
<p><a name="footnote102a"></a><a href="#citation102a"
class="footnote">[102a]</a>&nbsp; That is; Many who have departed
and joined the sects in sincerity and ignorance, may be
attributing to human causes that re-invigoration of spiritual
life, which is but the forgotten Baptismal grace of Christ,
mercifully &ldquo;<i>in them</i>, springing up to everlasting
life.&rdquo; (John iv. 14; John vii. 38, 39.)&nbsp; This may be
also, one of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> means of
humbling and reforming His too careless Church.</p>

affirmed generally the necessity of being &ldquo;born of

this; for no one misunderstands <i>them</i>, as some did the
Apostles, by supposing them to be establishing a temporal
rule.&nbsp; The Apostolic system evidently had that in it, which
furnished some apparent ground for such a mistake; and so also
the Catholic Church is sometimes charged with &ldquo;interfering
with the State.&rdquo;</p>

light on Tertullian&rsquo;s meaning in a passage quoted by Bishop
Kaye, (p. 226.)&nbsp; The word &ldquo;consessus&rdquo; seems to
allude to the expression of our Lord, &ldquo;where two or three
are <i>gathered together</i>;&rdquo; indeed in the same
connexion, he quotes this very text.&nbsp; And I would suggest,
that Tertullian&rsquo;s argument in this place, however ill
expressed, may perhaps imply, and certainly requires no more than
is stated above, viz. that the Sacerdotal grace was primarily or
essentially in the <span class="smcap">Church</span>, and not
originally in the <i>persons</i> of any individuals as such.</p>

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
